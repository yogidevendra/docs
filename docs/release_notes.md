DataTorrent RTS Release Notes
========================================================================================================================

Version: 3.7.0
Release date: Dec 30, 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Summary
The new features on this release are functionalities that will ease debugging an application and administering application alerts in production. 

Operation related features for a Dev Ops role:  
* Manage and see a history of previous alerts so that users can be aware of potential issues before they become critical. 
* View operator ID(s) and name(s) in the dtManage-Physical-Container list table to quickly identify what operators are in each container. 
* Filter matching tuple recordings by searching across tuple recording data.

Debugging features:
When trying to troubleshoot or debug a distributed system, these capabilities allow users to quickly identify problem areas and easily drill down into relevant details (i.e. logs). 
* Notify users when log files have been removed
* New Application Attempts section under Monitor. It is located along other views such as logical and physical
* New Application Master logs in Application Overview section
* New log button shortcut in Stram Events and Physical Operator section
* Show dead container logs in Running applications. That is to show history of physical operator containers and logs in the physical operator view. For each previous incarnation, there are start time, end time, link to corresponding logs, root cause with error code, and recovery window id.
* Show the same details for killed or finished application like running application view.
* Show container history as default in Physical Operator view
* New historic count field in Physical Operator view
* Get thread dump from a container. It is useful to analyze issues such as "stuck operator", and obtain statistics from the running JVM. In production environments users often don't have direct access to the machines, thus making it available through the REST API will help. 
* Option to auto tail container logs. When viewing a container log via the UI, there is an option to periodically poll for more data (i.e. "tail -f" effect).

dtAssemble
* New validate button so that user can validate DAG without having to save. 
* Remove auto save function. Save will be initiated by user only.
* Support custom JSON input for tuple schema creation. This is particularly useful when user needs to add a large number of fields. 

dtDashboard
* New gauge widget

AppHub
* Continued to refine application templates in AppHub (introduced in RTS 3.6.0).  

RTS 3.7.0 is based on Apache Apex Core 3.5.0 (released Dec 19, 2016) and Apache Apex Malhar 3.6.0 (released Dec 8, 2016).

Apache Apex Core 3.5.0:
This release upgrades the Apache Hadoop YARN dependency from 2.2 to 2.6. The community determined that current users run on versions equal or higher than 2.6 and Apex can now take advantage of more recent capabilities of YARN. The release contains a number of important bug fixes and operability improvements. 
Change log: https://github.com/apache/apex-core/blob/v3.5.0/CHANGELOG.md

Apache Apex Malhar 3.6.0 
The release adds first iteration of SQL support via Apache Calcite. Features include SELECT, INSERT, INNER JOIN with non-empty equi join condition, WHERE clause, SCALAR functions that are implemented in Calcite, custom scalar functions. Endpoint can be file, Kafka or internal streaming port for both input and output. CSV format is implemented for both input and output. See examples for usage of the new API.

The windowed state management has been improved (WindowedOperator). There is now an option to use spillable data structures for the state storage. This enables the operator to store large states and perform efficient checkpointing.

There was also benchmarking on WindowedOperator with the spillable data structures. From the result, the community significantly improved how objects are serialized and reduced garbage collection considerably in the Managed State layer. Work is still in progress for purging state that is not needed any more and further improving the performance of Managed State that the spillable data structures depend on. More information about the windowing support can be found at http://apex.apache.org/docs/malhar/operators/windowedOperator/.

This release also adds a new, alternative Cassandra output operator (non-transactional, upsert based) and support for fixed length file format to the enrichment operator.

Version: 3.5.0
Release date: Sep 26, 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary
DataTorrent RTS continues to deliver features that sets it apart in bringing operability in running an enterprise grade big data-in-motion platform. This particular release brought new features such as

* Allowing users to analyze "stuck operator" by obtaining stats from the running JVM (i.e. GC stats and thread dump)
* Ability to show/hide critical path in both logical and physical DAG

### Apache Apex Malhar
The other important part of going to production is a library of operators that is more than just functional. They need to be fault tolerant, partitionable, support idempotency, and dynamically scalable. The recent release of Apache Apex Malhar 3.5.0 provides new and updated operators and APIs to bring those enterprise features. 

* Windowed Operator that supports the windowing semantics outlined by Apache Beam and Google Cloud DataFlow, including the concepts of event time windows, session windows, watermarks, allowed lateness, and triggering.
* High level Java stream API now uses the aforementioned Windowed Operator to support stateful transformation with Apache Beam style windowing semantics.
* Introduction of Spillable Data Structures that make use of Managed State.
* Deduper Operator to process  whether a given record is a duplicate or not
* Enricher Operator to join a stream with a lookup source and operate on any POJO object
* HBase input operator. Improve HBasePOJOInputOperator with support for threaded read
* File Record reader module. It is useful for reading from files "line by line" in parallel and emit each line as seperate * tuple.
* JDBC Poll Input Operator

### Summary
Affinity rules provides a way to specify hints on how operators should be deployed in a Hadoop cluster. There are two types of rules: affinity and anti-affinity rules. Affinity rule indicates that the group of operators in the rule should be allocated together. Anti-affinity rule, the new feature in Apache Apex 3.4.0, indicates that the group of operators should be allocated separately.

This release also includes a lot of bug fixes. Please see appendix for full list. 

### dtManage
* User can restart a killed application from dtManage
* "Retrieve Ended Apps" button changes to "Hide Ended Apps" after dtManage retrieves killed apps.
* User can use mouse scroll to zoom in/out of physical DAG view

### Apache Apex 3.4.0
* Blacklist problem nodes from future container requests
* Support adding module to application using property file API.

### Summary

#### dtHub
DataTorrent RTS allows companies to quickly build low latency real time Big Data application that can scale and fault tolerant. With the introduction of dtHub, DataTorrent now host and maintain an application distributor. You can access it through dtManage and easily install or update application without having to upgrade the whole RTS platform. Prior to dtHub, RTS installer packaged both platform and applications. In 3.3, they are decoupled with significantly reduced installer size. You can independently choose when to upgrade the platform and when to install/upgrade applications.

#### dtManage
* Troubleshooting is made easier now that user can view the containers where physical operators have lived
* RTS Community Edition user can now view container logs and set log levels via dtManage. API for runtime DAG and property change are also available
* RTS Enterprise Edition is changed from 30 days to 60 days
* When an application is killed, RTS will delete the app directory according to policy  in dt-site.xml

#### dtDasbhoard
* New widgets for the dashboard: Geo coordinates with circles, Geo regions with gradient fill and single Value 

#### dtAssemble (beta)
* Top level “Develop” takes users directly to Application Page
* Navigation changes on how user get to Tuple Schema. User goes to It is now "Edit Application" then "Tuple Schema"
* Development (breadcrumb link)

#### Documentation 
* FileSplitter: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/file_splitter/
* Block Reader: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/block_reader/

#### Apache Apex 3.3 
* Support for iterative processing. It is a building block to support machine learning
* Ability to populate DAG at application launch time
* Pre checkpoint operator callback so that it can execute a logic before the operator gets checkpointed (e.g. flush file to HDFS)
* Provide the option for operator to do checkpointing in a distribute in-memory store. It is faster than HDFS due to disk i/o latency
* Add group ID information in an applicatin package.  It is visible for application grouping in dtHub.
