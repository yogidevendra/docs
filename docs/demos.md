Configuring Launch Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some applications may require additional configuration changes prior to launching.  Configuration changes can be made on the launch confirmation screen or manually applied to `~/.dt/dt-site.xml` configuration file.  These typically include adding Twitter API keys for twitter demo, or changing performance settings for larger applications.

1.  Navigate to **AppHub** of the DataTorrent console.  In this example, we will use **Twitter Demo** application package. Click *Import* button. 

2.  Navigate to **Develop > Application Packages**. From the list of Applications, select TwitterDemo and press the corresponding launch button.

3.  Retrieve Twitter API access information by registering for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="\_blank">Twitter Developer</a> account, creating a new <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new" target="\_blank">Twitter Application</a>, and navigating to Keys and Access Tokens tab.  Twitter Demo application requires the following to be specified by the user:

    dt.operator.TweetSampler.accessToken
    dt.operator.TweetSampler.accessTokenSecret
    dt.operator.TweetSampler.consumerKey
    dt.operator.TweetSampler.consumerSecret

4.  Select *Specify custom properties* on the launch confirmation screen, click *add required properties* button, and provide Twitter API access values.  Choose to save this configuration as `twitter.xml` file and proceed to Launch the application.
