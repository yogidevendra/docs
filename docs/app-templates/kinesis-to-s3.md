   For example, suppose we wish to process all messages from Kinesis stream `transactions` 
      and write them to `output.txt` under `/user/appuser/output` on S3. Properties should be set as follows:

    |name|value|
    |---|---|
    |Stream Name For Kinesis Input|transactions|
    |Access Key For Kinesis Input|KINESIS_ACCESS_KEY|
    |Secret Key For Kinesis Input|KINESIS_SECRET_KEY|
    |End Point For Kinesis Input|KINESIS_END_POINT|
    |Access Key For S3Output|S3_ACCESS_KEY|
    |Secret Access Key For S3Output|S3_SECRET_KEY|
    |S3Output Bucket Name|S3_BUCKET_NAME|
    |S3Output Directory Path|/user/appuser/output|

    Details about configuration options are available in [Configuration options](#configuration_options) section.

1. Click on the `Launch` button on lower right corner of the dialog to launch the application.
A notification is displayed on the top right corner after application is launched successfully and includes the Application ID which can be used to monitor this instance and find its logs.
