            "text": "Beginner's Guide to Apache Apex\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nApache Apex is a fault-tolerant, high-performance platform and framework for building\ndistributed applications; it is built on Hadoop. This guide is targeted at Java\ndevelopers who are getting started with building Apex applications.\n\n\nQuickstart\n\n\nThose eager to get started right away can download, build, and run a few sample\napplications; just follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have \nJava JDK\n, \nmaven\n and \ngit\n installed.\n\n\nClone the examples git repo: \nhttps://github.com/DataTorrent/examples\n\n\nSwitch to \ntutorials/fileOutput\n and build it either in your favorite IDE or on the command line with:\n\n\n\n\ncd examples/tutorials/fileOutput\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the test in your IDE or on the command line with:\n\n\n\n\nmvn test\n\n\n\n\nSome of the applications are discussed in the \nSample Applications\n section below.\nThe rest of this document provides a more leisurely introduction to Apex.\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\n\nBefore beginning development, you'll need to make sure the following prerequisites\nare present; details of setting up your development environment are\n\nhere\n:\n\n\n\n\nRecent versions of the Java JDK, maven, git.\n\n\nA Hadoop cluster where the application can be deployed.\n\n\nA working internet connection.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the maven archetype\n\n\nApex applications use the \nmaven\n build tool. The maven archetype is useful for avoiding\nthe tedious process of creating a suitable \npom.xml\n maven build file by hand; it also\ngenerates a simple default application with two operators that you can build and run\nwithout having to write any code or make any changes. To run it, place the following\nlines in a text file (called, say \nnewapp.sh\n) and run it with the shell\n(e.g. \nbash newapp.sh\n):\n\n\nv=\n3.3.0-incubating\n\nmvn -B archetype:generate \\\n  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.apex \\\n  -DarchetypeArtifactId=apex-app-archetype \\\n  -DarchetypeVersion=\n$v\n \\\n  -DgroupId=com.example \\\n  -Dpackage=com.example.myapexapp \\\n  -DartifactId=myapexapp \\\n  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n\n\n\nAs new versions are released, you might need to update the version number (the\nthe variable \nv\n above). You can also run the archetype from your Java IDE as described\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nIt should create a new project directory named \nmyapexapp\n with these 3 Java source files:\n\n\nsrc/test/java/com/example/myapexapp/ApplicationTest.java\nsrc/main/java/com/example/myapexapp/Application.java\nsrc/main/java/com/example/myapexapp/RandomNumberGenerator.java\n\n\n\n\nThe project should also contain these properties files:\n\n\nsrc/site/conf/my-app-conf1.xml\nsrc/main/resources/META-INF/properties.xml\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to step into the new directory and build the project:\n\n\ncd myapexapp; mvn clean package -DskipTests\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a directory named \ntarget\n and an application package file\nwithin it named \nmyapexapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apa\n.\n\n\nThese files are discussed further in the sections below.\n\n\nThe default application\n\n\nWe now discuss the default application generated by the archetype in some detail.\nAdditional, more realistic applications are presented in the section titled\n\nSample Applications\n below.\n\n\nThe default application creates an application in \nApplication.java\n with 2 operators:\n\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation(name=\nMyFirstApplication\n)\npublic class Application implements StreamingApplication\n{\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration conf) {\n    RandomNumberGenerator randomGenerator = dag.addOperator(\nrandomGenerator\n, RandomNumberGenerator.class);\n    randomGenerator.setNumTuples(500);\n    ConsoleOutputOperator cons = dag.addOperator(\nconsole\n, new ConsoleOutputOperator());\n    dag.addStream(\nrandomData\n, randomGenerator.out, cons.input).setLocality(Locality.CONTAINER_LOCAL);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe application is named \nMyFirstApplication\n via the annotation\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation\n; this name will be displayed in the UI console and must be\nunique among the applications running on a cluster. It can also be changed at launch time.\n\n\nThe \npopulateDAG\n method is the only one that you'll need to implement. Its contents\nfall into three categories: operator creation, operator configuration, and stream\ncreation.\n\n\nTwo operators are created: \nrandomGenerator\n and \nconsole\n. The first is\ndefined in \nRandomNumberGenerator.java\n; it generates random\nfloating point values and emits them on its output port. The second is an instance\nof \nConsoleOutputOperator\n class defined in \nMalhar\n \n the library of pre-built\noperators. The first argument to \naddOperator()\n is the name of this operator instance\n(there can be multiple instances of the same class, so we need a unique name to\ndistinguish them); the second can be either a class object that needs to be instantiated\nas shown for \nrandomGenerator\n or an actual instance of that class as shown for \nconsole\n.\n\n\nThe operators can be configured by calling setter methods on them; the call to\n\nsetNumTuples\n is an example. However, operators are typically configured via XML\nproperties files as discussed in later sections below.\n\n\nFinally, the \naddStream\n call creates a stream named \nrandomData\n connecting the\noutput port of first operator to the input port of the second.\n\n\nRunning the application and the unit test\n\n\nThe file \nApplicationTest.java\n contains a unit test that can be run from an IDE\nby highlighting the \ntestApplication\n method and selecting the appropriate\noption from the dropdown; it can also be run the maven command line:\n\n\nmvn -Dtest=ApplicationTest#testApplication test\n\n\n\n\nIt runs for about 10 seconds printing each random number with a prefix of \nhello world:\n.\nThe first argument explicitly selects the test to run (\ntestApplication\n)\nfrom the named class (\nApplicationTest\n); you can omit it and just run \nmvn test\n to\nrun all of the unit tests.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this particular test is actually a test of the entire\napplication rather than a single class or a method within a class. It uses a class\ncalled \nLocalMode\n to essentially simulate a cluster. It is an extremely useful\ntechnique for testing your application without the need for a cluster. It can be used\nin more elaborate ways to test complex applications as discussed in the section\nentitled \nLocal Mode Testing\n below.\n\n\nTo run the application, you need access to a cluster with Hadoop installed; there are\nmultiple options here:\n\n\n\n\nDownload and setup the sandbox as described\n  \nhere\n. This is\n  the simplest option for experimenting with Apex since it has all the necessary pieces\n  installed.\n\n\nDownload and install the DataTorrent Community or Enterprise Edition downloadable from\n  \nhere\n.\n\n\nUse an existing DataTorrent RTS licensed installation.\n\n\nClone the Apex source code on a cluster with Hadoop already installed, build it and\n  use the \napexcli\n command line tool (previously named \ndtcli\n) from there to run your\n  application as described in \nthis video\n.\n\n\n\n\nWith the first 3 methods, you have a browser-based GUI console and you can simply\nnavigate to \nDevelop\n \n \nUpload Package\n and upload the \n.apa\n file built earlier;\nthen run it using the \nlaunch\n button. If using the command line tool, run that tool\nthen use the command \nlaunch myapexapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apa\n to launch the application. You\ncan also specify a particular XML configuration file that is packaged with the\napplication to use during launch, for example:\n\nlaunch -apconf my-app-conf1.xml myapexapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apa\n\nFor an exhaustive list of commands available with this tool, please see\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nMore details about configuration files are provided in the next section.\n\n\nConfiguring your application\n\n\nApplication configuration is typically done via XML properties files though it can also\nbe done with code as shown above. The \nproperties.xml\n file mentioned earlier has some\nexamples:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.MyFirstApplication.operator.randomGenerator.prop.numTuples\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n1000\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.MyFirstApplication.operator.console.prop.stringFormat\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\nhello world: %s\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of tuples output per window (windows are discussed in greater detail below)\nis set both in the code and in this file; in such cases, values in this properties\nfile override those set in the code.\n\n\nConfiguration values can also be placed in XML\nfiles under \nsite/conf\n and the file \nmy-app-conf1.xml\n mentioned above is an example.\nThese files are not processed automatically; they need to be explicitly selected at\nlaunch time. To do this in the GUI, select the \nUse saved configuration\n checkbox in\nthe launch dialog and choose the desired file from the dropdown. When a property is\nspecified in multiple files, precedence rules determine the final value; those rules\nare discussed\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nAttributes and Properties\n\n\nProperties are simply public accessor methods in the operator classes and govern the\nfunctionality of the operator. Attributes on the other hand are pre-defined and affect\nhow the operator or application behaves with respect to its environment. We have already\nseen a couple of examples of properties, namely, the number of tuples emitted per window\nby the random number generator (\nnumTuples\n) and the prefix string appended to each\nvalue before it is output by the console operator (\nstringFormat\n).\n\n\nOperator properties that are more complex objects than the primitive types can also\nbe initialized from XML files. For example, if we have properties declared as\n\nint[] counts;\n and \nString[] paths;\n in an operator named \nfoo\n, we can initialize\nthem with:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.foo.prop.counts\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n10, 20, 30\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.foo.prop.paths\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n/tmp/path1\n, \n/tmp/path3\n, \n/tmp/path3\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an attribute is the amount of memory allocated to the Buffer Server (see\nsection below entitled \nBuffer Server\n); it is named \nBUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n can be set\nlike this:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.{appName}.operator.{opName}.port.{portName}.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n128\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nHere \n{appName}\n, \n{opName}\n, \n{portName}\n are appropriate application, operator\nand port names respectively; they can also be replaced with asterisks (wildcards). The\ndefault value is 512MB.\n\n\nSome additional attributes include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPARTITIONER\n\n\ncustom partitioner class associated with an operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPARTITION_PARALLEL\n\n\nif true, triggers parallel partitioning of a downstream operator when an upstream operator is partitioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTREAM_CODEC\n\n\ncontrols serialization/deserialization as well as destination partitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOVERY_ATTEMPTS\n\n\nmaximum restart attempts of a failed operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently available attribute names are in \nContext\n class of the \napi\n module in\nApex source code.\n\n\nFor additional examples of initialization of properties, including list and map\nobjects, please look\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nLocal Mode Testing\n\n\nAs noted above, the \nLocalMode\n class is used for testing the application locally in\nyour development environment. A common, though suboptimal, use looks like this:\n\n\ntry {\n  LocalMode lma = LocalMode.newInstance();\n  Configuration conf = new Configuration(false);\n  conf.addResource(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(\n/META-INF/properties.xml\n));\n  lma.prepareDAG(new Application(), conf);\n  LocalMode.Controller lc = lma.getController();\n  lc.run(10000); // runs for 10 seconds and quits\n} catch (ConstraintViolationException e) {\n  Assert.fail(\nconstraint violations: \n + e.getConstraintViolations());\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere, a \nConfiguration\n object containing all the appropriate settings of properties and\nattributes for the application is created by parsing the default \nproperties.xml\n file,\na new \nApplication\n object is created and configured and finally a controller used for\ntimed execution of the application. This approach, though occasionally useful to uncover\nshallow bugs, has one glaring deficiency \n it does not check the results in any way\nas most unit tests do. We strongly recommend avoiding this usage pattern.\n\n\nA far better (and recommended) approach is to write data to some storage system\nthat can then be queried for verification. An example of this approach is\n\nhere\n and looks like this:\n\n\ntry {\n  LocalMode lma = LocalMode.newInstance();\n  lma.prepareDAG(new Application(), getConfig());\n  LocalMode.Controller lc = lma.getController();\n  lc.runAsync();\n\n  // wait for output files to show up\n  while ( ! check() ) {\n    System.out.println(\nSleeping ....\n);\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n  }\n} catch (ConstraintViolationException e) {\n  Assert.fail(\nconstraint violations: \n + e.getConstraintViolations());\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we invoke \nrunAsync\n on the controller to fork off a separate thread to run the\napplication while the main thread enters a loop where it looks for the presence of the\nexpected output files. A pair of functions can be defined to setup prerequisites such\nas starting external servers, creating directories, etc. and perform the corresponding\nteardown upon test termination; these functions are annotated with \n@Before\n and \n@After\n.\n\n\nChecking logs\n\n\nLogs for the Application Master and the various containers can be retrieved and viewed\non the UI console by navigating to the \nPhysical\n tab, clicking on the specific container\nin question, clicking on the blue \nlogs\n button and then selecting the appropriate file\nfrom the dropdown. If you don't have access to the UI, you'll need to log in to the\nappropriate node on the cluster and check the logs there.\n\n\nA good starting point is the\nYARN log file which is usually present at \n/var/log/hadoop-yarn\n or \n/var/log/hadoop\n or\nsimilar locations and named \nyarn-{user}-resourcemanager-{host}.log\n or\n\nhadoop-cmf-yarn-RESOURCEMANAGER-{host}.log.out\n (where \n{user}\n and \n{host}\n have\nappropriate values) or something similar. This file will\nindicate what containers were allocated for each application, whether the allocation\nsucceeded or failed and where each container is running. Typically, application and\ncontainer ids will have the respective forms \napplication_1448033276100_0001\n and\n\ncontainer_1462948052533_0001_01_022468\n.\n\n\nIf the application failed \nduring\n launch,\nthe YARN logs will usually have enough information to diagnose the root cause -- for\nexample, a container requiring more memory than is available. If the application launch\nwas successful, you'll see the containers transition through various states: \nNEW\n,\n\nALLOCATED\n, \nACQUIRED\n, \nRUNNING\n.\n\n\nIf it failed \nafter\n launch, the logs of the particular container that failed will shed\nmore light on the issue. Those logs are located on the appropriate node under a\ndirectory with the same name as the container id which itself is under a directory\nnamed with the application id, for example:\n\n\ndtadmin@dtbox:/sfw/hadoop/shared/logs$ cd nodemanager/application_1465857463845_0001/\ndtadmin@dtbox:/sfw/hadoop/shared/logs/nodemanager/application_1465857463845_0001$ ls\ncontainer_1465857463845_0001_01_000001  container_1465857463845_0001_01_000003\ncontainer_1465857463845_0001_01_000002  container_1465857463845_0001_01_000004\ndtadmin@dtbox:/sfw/hadoop/shared/logs/nodemanager/application_1465857463845_0001$ ls *1\nAppMaster.stderr  AppMaster.stdout  dt.log\ndtadmin@dtbox:/sfw/hadoop/shared/logs/nodemanager/application_1465857463845_0001$ ls *2\ndt.log  stderr  stdout\n\n\n\n\nThe Application Master container id always has the suffix \n_000001\n.\n\n\nOperators, Ports and Streams\n\n\nAn \noperator\n is, simply put, a class that\nimplements the \nOperator\n interface. Though the class could be written to directly\nimplement that interface, a more common and easier method is to extend \nBaseOperator\n\nsince it provides default empty implementations of all the required methods.\nWe've already seen an example above, namely \nRandomNumberGenerator\n.\n\n\nA \nport\n is a class that can either emit (output port) or ingest (input port) data.\nInput and output ports implement the \nInputPort\n and \nOutputPort\n interfaces\nrespectively. More commonly, output ports are simply defined as instances of\n\nDefaultOutputPort\n, for example:\n\n\npublic final transient DefaultOutputPort\nDouble\n out = new DefaultOutputPort\nDouble\n();\n\n\n\n\nand input ports are defined as anonymous inner classes that extend \nDefaultInputPort\n:\n\n\npublic final transient DefaultInputPort\nDouble\n input = new DefaultInputPort\nDouble\n()\n{\n  @Override\n  public void process(Double v) {\n    out.emit(v);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nA \nstream\n is the set of links connecting a single port of an upstream operator to one or\nmore input ports of downstream operators. We've already seen an example of a stream above,\nnamely \nrandomData\n. If the upstream operator is not partitioned, tuples are delivered to\nthe input ports of a stream in the same order in which they were written to the output\nport; this guarantee may change in the future. For a more detailed explanation of these\nconcepts, please\nlook \nhere\n.\n\n\nAnnotations\n\n\nAnnotations are an important tool for expressing desired guarantees which are then\nverified in a validation phase before running the application. Some examples:\n\n\n@Min(1)\nint index;\n\n@NotNull\nString name\n\n@NotNull\n@Size(min=1, max=128)\nprivate String[] path;\n\n@NotNull\n@Size(min = 1)\nprivate final Set\nString\n files;\n\n@Valid\nFooBar object;\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@Min\n and \n@Max\n annotations check lower and upper bounds; \n@Size\n checks the\nsize of a collection or array against minimum and maximum limits; \n@Valid\n requests\nrecursive validation checks on the object.\n\n\nThere are also a few Apex-specific annotations; we've seen one example above, namely\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation\n used to set the name of the application. A couple of others\nare useful to declare that a port within an operator need not be connected:\n\n\n@InputPortFieldAnnotation(optional = true)\npublic final transient InputPort\nObject\n inportWithCodec = new DefaultInputPort\n();\n\n@OutputPortFieldAnnotation(optional = true)\npublic final transient DefaultOutputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n outBindings\n   = new DefaultOutputPort\n();\n\n\n\n\nFor additional information about annotations, please see:\n\nhere\n and\n\nhere\n\n\nPartitioners, Unifiers and StreamCodecs\n\n\nPartitioning is a mechanism for load balancing; it involves replicating one or more\noperators so that the load can be shared by all the replicas. Partitioning is\naccomplished by the \ndefinePartitions\n method of the \nPartitioner\n interface.\nA couple of implementations are available: \nStatelessPartitioner\n (static partitioning)\nand \nStatelessThroughputBasedPartitioner\n (dynamic partitioning, see below).\nThese can be used by setting the \nPARTITIONER\n\nattribute on the operator by including a stanza like the following in your\nconfiguration file (where \n{appName}\n and \n{opName}\n are the\nappropriate application and operator names):\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.{appName}.operator.{opName}.attr.PARTITIONER\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:2\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number after the colon specifies the number of desired partitions. This can be\ndone for any operator that is not a connector (i.e. input or output operator) and is not\nannotated with \n@OperatorAnnotation(partitionable = false)\n. No code changes are necessary.\nIncoming tuples entering input ports of the operator are automatically distributed among the\npartitions based on their hash code by default. You can get greater control of how tuples\nare distributed to partitions by using a \nStreamCodec\n; further discussion of stream\ncodecs is deferred to the Advanced Guide [\ncoming soon\n].\nA small sample program illustrating use of stream codecs is\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nConnectors need special care since they interact with external systems. Many connectors\n(e.g. Kafka input, file input and output operators) implement the \nPartitioner\n\ninterface and support partitioning using custom implementations of \ndefinePartitions\n\n\nwithin\n the operator.\nDocumentation and/or source code of the individual connectors should be consulted for\ndetails.\n\n\nSometimes there is need to replicate an entire linear segment of the DAG; this is\nknown as \nParallel Partitioning\n and is achieved by setting the \nPARTITION_PARALLEL\n\nattribute on the input port of each downstream operator that is part of the linear\nsegment. Both of these mechanisms are described in greater detail in the\n\nAdvanced Features\n section of the\n\nTop N Words tutorial\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the \nStatelessPartitioner\n is used for \nstatic\n\npartitioning since it occurs once before the application starts. Dynamic partitioning\nwhile the application is running is also possible using the\n\nStatelessThroughputBasedPartitioner\n or a custom partitioner. Implementing such\na partitioner needs special care, especially if the operator to be partitioned\nhas some accumulated state since this state typically needs to be redistributed among\nthe newly created partitions. An example of a custom partitioner that does dynamic\npartitioning is \nhere\n.\n\n\nUnifiers are the flip side of the partitioning coin: When data that was intended to be\nprocessed by a single instance is now processed by multiple partitions, each instance\ncomputes partial results since it processes only part of the stream; these partial\nresults need to be combined to form the final result; this is the function of a unifier.\n\n\nFor example, suppose an operator is processing numbers and computes the sum of all the\nvalues seen in a window. If it is partitioned into N replicas, each replica is computing\na partial sum and we would need a unifier that computes the overall sum from\nthese N partial sums. A sample application that shows how to define and use a unifier is\navailable \nhere\n.\n\n\nA unifier for an operator is provided by a suitable override of the \ngetUnifier()\n method\nof the output port, for example:\n\n\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nHighLow\nInteger\n out\n    = new DefaultOutputPort\nHighLow\nInteger\n() {\n    @Override\n    public Unifier\nHighLow\nInteger\n getUnifier() {\n      return new UnifierRange\nInteger\n()\n    }\n  };\n\n\n\n\nIf no unifier is supplied for a partitioned operator, the platform will supply a default\npass-through unifier.\n\n\nWhen the number of partitions is large and the unifier involves non-trivial computations\nthere is a risk that it can become a bottleneck; in such cases, the \nUNIFIER_LIMIT\n\nattribute can be set on the appropriate output port. The platform will then automatically\ngenerate the required number of parallel unifiers, cascading into multiple levels if\nnecessary, to ensure that the number of input streams at each unifier does not exceed\nthis limit.\n\n\nBuffer Server\n\n\nThe \nBuffer Server\n is a separate service within a container which implements\na publish-subscribe model. It is present whenever the container hosts an operator\nwith an output port connected to another operator outside the container.\n\n\nThe output port is the publisher and the connected input ports of downstream operators\nare the subscribers. It buffers tuples so that they can be replayed when a\ndownstream operator fails and is restarted. As described earlier, the memory allocated\nto a buffer server is user configurable via an attribute named \nBUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n and\ndefaults to 512MB.\n\n\nThe total memory required by a container that hosts many such operators may climb rapidly;\nreducing the value of this attribute is advisable in such cases in a memory constrained\nenvironment.\n\n\nAllocating Operator Memory\n\n\nA container is a JVM process; the maximum memory each such container can consume is\nuser configurable via the \nMEMORY_MB\n attribute whose default value is 1GB.\nIf it is too large, container allocation may fail before the application even\nbegins; if it is too small, the application may fail at run time as it tries to\nallocate memory and runs up against this limit.\nAn example of setting this limit:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.MyFirstApplication.operator.randomGenerator.attr.MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n300\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, wildcards can be used to set the same value for all operators by replacing\nthe operator name \nrandomGenerator\n with an asterisk. The application name can also be\nomitted, so a shorter version is:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.*.attr.MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n300\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Application Master (aka \nStrAM\n) is a supervisory Java process associated with each\napplication; memory allocation for it is specified slightly differently:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n700\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nFor small applications, a value as low as 700 may be adequate; for larger applications,\na value 2000 or more may be needed. If this value is too small, the application typically\nfails at startup with no user-visible diagnostics; YARN logs need to be examined in such\ncases.\n\n\nSample Applications\n\n\nThis section briefly discusses some sample applications using commonly used connectors.\nThe applications themselves are available at\n\nExamples\n.\nWe briefly describe a few of them below.\n\n\nEach example has a brief \nREADME.md\n file (in markdown format) describing what the\napplication does. In most cases, the unit tests function as full application tests that\ncan be run locally in your development environment without the need for a cluster as\ndescribed above.\n\n\nApplication \n file copy\n\n\nThe \nfileIO-simple\n application copies all data verbatim from files added to an input\ndirectory to rolling files in an output directory. The input and output directories,\nthe output file base name and maximum size are configured in \nMETA_INF/properties.xml\n:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.SimpleFileIO.operator.input.prop.directory\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n/tmp/SimpleFileIO/input-dir\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.SimpleFileIO.operator.output.prop.filePath\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n/tmp/SimpleFileIO/output-dir\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.SimpleFileIO.operator.output.prop.fileName\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\nmyfile\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.SimpleFileIO.operator.output.prop.maxLength\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n1000000\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application DAG is created in \nApplication.java\n:\n\n\n@Override\npublic void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration conf)\n{\n  // create operators\n  FileLineInputOperator in = dag.addOperator(\ninput\n, new FileLineInputOperator());\n  FileOutputOperator out = dag.addOperator(\noutput\n, new FileOutputOperator());\n\n  // create streams\n  dag.addStream(\ndata\n, in.output, out.input);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFileLineInputOperator\n is part of Malhar and is a concrete class that extends\n\nAbstractFileInputOperator\n. The \nFileOutputOperator\n is defined locally\nand extends the \nAbstractFileOutputOperator\n and overrides 3 methods:\n+ \ngetFileName\n which simply returns the current file name\n+ \ngetBytesForTuple\n which appends a newline to the argument string, converts it to an array of bytes and returns it.\n+ \nsetup\n which creates the actual file name by appending the operator id to the configured base name (this last step is necessary when partitioning is involved to ensure that multiple partitions do not write to the same file).\n\n\nOutput files are created with temporary names like \nmyfile_p2.0.1465929407447.tmp\n and\nrenamed to \nmyfile_p2.0\n when they reach the maximum configured size.\n\n\nApplication \n database to file\n\n\nThe \njdbcIngest\n application reads rows from a table in \nMySQL\n, creates Java objects\n(_POJO_s) and writes them to a file in the user specified directory in HDFS.\n\n\nApplication configuration values are specified in 2 files: \n\nMETA_INF/properties.xml\n and \nsrc/site/conf/example.xml\n. The former uses the in-memory\ndatabase \nHSQLDB\n and is used by the unit test in JdbcInputAppTest; this test can be\nrun, as described earlier, either in your IDE or using maven on the command line.\nThe latter uses \nMySql\n and is intended for use on a cluster. To run on a cluster you'll\nneed a couple of preparatory steps:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure \nMySql\n is installed on the cluster.\n\n\nChange \nexample.xml\n to reflect proper values for \ndatabaseUrl\n, \nuserName\n, \npassword\n and \nfilePath\n.\n\n\nCreate the required table and rows by running the SQL queries in the file \nsrc/test/resources/example.sql\n.\n\n\nCreate the HDFS output directory if necessary.\n\n\nBuild the project to create the \n.apa\n package\n\n\nLaunch the application, selecting \nexample.xml\n as the configuration file during launch.\n\n\nVerify that the expected output file is present.\n\n\n\n\nFurther details on these steps are in the project \nREADME.md\n file.\n\n\nThe application uses two operators: The first is \nFileLineOutputOperator\n which extends\n\nAbstractFileOutputOperator\n and provides implementations for two methods:\n\ngetFileName\n and \ngetBytesForTuple\n. The former creates a file name using the operator\nid \n this is important if this operator has multiple partitions and prevents the\npartitions from writing to the same file (which could cause garbled data). The latter\nsimply converts the incoming object to an array of bytes and returns it.\n\n\nThe second is \nJdbcPOJOInputOperator\n which comes from Malhar; it reads records from\na table and outputs them on the output port; they type of object that is emitted is\nspecified by the value of the  \nTUPLE_CLASS\n attribute in the configuration file\nnamely \nPojoEvent\n in this case. This operator also needs a couple of additional\nproperties: (a) a list of \nFieldInfo\n objects that describe the mapping from table\ncolumns to fields of the Pojo; and (b) a \nstore\n object that deals with the details\nof establishing a connection to the database server.\n\n\nThe application itself is then created in the usual way in \nJdbcHDFSApp.populateDAG\n:\n\n\nJdbcPOJOInputOperator jdbcInputOperator = dag.addOperator(\nJdbcInput\n, new JdbcPOJOInputOperator());\njdbcInputOperator.setFieldInfos(addFieldInfos());\n\njdbcInputOperator.setStore(new JdbcStore());\n\nFileLineOutputOperator fileOutput = dag.addOperator(\nFileOutputOperator\n, new FileLineOutputOperator());\n\ndag.addStream(\nPOJO's\n, jdbcInputOperator.outputPort, fileOutput.input).setLocality(Locality.CONTAINER_LOCAL);\n\n\n\n\nAppHub\n\n\nAppHub\n is a source of application templates. There are many more applications for various use cases to help jump start development effort. \n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment environment setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting guide",

The second is an instance\nof  ConsoleOutputOperator  class defined in  Malhar    the library of pre-built\noperators. The first argument to  addOperator()  is the name of this operator instance\n(there can be multiple instances of the same class, so we need a unique name to\ndistinguish them); the second can be either a class object that needs to be instantiated\nas shown for  randomGenerator  or an actual instance of that class as shown for  console .  The operators can be configured by calling setter methods on them; the call to setNumTuples  is an example. However, operators are typically configured via XML\nproperties files as discussed in later sections below.  Finally, the  addStream  call creates a stream named  randomData  connecting the\noutput port of first operator to the input port of the second.",

Partitioning is\naccomplished by the  definePartitions  method of the  Partitioner  interface.\nA couple of implementations are available:  StatelessPartitioner  (static partitioning)\nand  StatelessThroughputBasedPartitioner  (dynamic partitioning, see below).\nThese can be used by setting the  PARTITIONER \nattribute on the operator by including a stanza like the following in your\nconfiguration file (where  {appName}  and  {opName}  are the\nappropriate application and operator names):  property \n   name dt.application.{appName}.operator.{opName}.attr.PARTITIONER /name \n   value com.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:2 /value  /property   The number after the colon specifies the number of desired partitions. This can be\ndone for any operator that is not a connector (i.e. input or output operator) and is not\nannotated with  @OperatorAnnotation(partitionable = false) . No code changes are necessary.\nIncoming tuples entering input ports of the operator are automatically distributed among the\npartitions based on their hash code by default. You can get greater control of how tuples\nare distributed to partitions by using a  StreamCodec ; further discussion of stream\ncodecs is deferred to the Advanced Guide [ coming soon ].\nA small sample program illustrating use of stream codecs is here .  Connectors need special care since they interact with external systems. Many connectors\n(e.g. Kafka input, file input and output operators) implement the  Partitioner \ninterface and support partitioning using custom implementations of  definePartitions  within  the operator.\nDocumentation and/or source code of the individual connectors should be consulted for\ndetails.  Sometimes there is need to replicate an entire linear segment of the DAG; this is\nknown as  Parallel Partitioning  and is achieved by setting the  PARTITION_PARALLEL \nattribute on the input port of each downstream operator that is part of the linear\nsegment. Both of these mechanisms are described in greater detail in the Advanced Features  section of the Top N Words tutorial  As mentioned above, the  StatelessPartitioner  is used for  static \npartitioning since it occurs once before the application starts. Dynamic partitioning\nwhile the application is running is also possible using the StatelessThroughputBasedPartitioner  or a custom partitioner. Implementing such\na partitioner needs special care, especially if the operator to be partitioned\nhas some accumulated state since this state typically needs to be redistributed among\nthe newly created partitions. An example of a custom partitioner that does dynamic\npartitioning is  here .  Unifiers are the flip side of the partitioning coin: When data that was intended to be\nprocessed by a single instance is now processed by multiple partitions, each instance\ncomputes partial results since it processes only part of the stream; these partial\nresults need to be combined to form the final result; this is the function of a unifier.  For example, suppose an operator is processing numbers and computes the sum of all the\nvalues seen in a window. If it is partitioned into N replicas, each replica is computing\na partial sum and we would need a unifier that computes the overall sum from\nthese N partial sums. A sample application that shows how to define and use a unifier is\navailable  here .  A unifier for an operator is provided by a suitable override of the  getUnifier()  method\nof the output port, for example:    public final transient DefaultOutputPort HighLow Integer  out\n    = new DefaultOutputPort HighLow Integer () {\n    @Override\n    public Unifier HighLow Integer  getUnifier() {\n      return new UnifierRange Integer ()\n    }\n  };  If no unifier is supplied for a partitioned operator, the platform will supply a default\npass-through unifier.  When the number of partitions is large and the unifier involves non-trivial computations\nthere is a risk that it can become a bottleneck; in such cases, the  UNIFIER_LIMIT \nattribute can be set on the appropriate output port. The platform will then automatically\ngenerate the required number of parallel unifiers, cascading into multiple levels if\nnecessary, to ensure that the number of input streams at each unifier does not exceed\nthis limit.",

This\nissue is discussed in more detail in the Appendix entitled \nFurther Explorations\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are have trouble with any of the following steps, or have not\ncomplete the preceding sections in this tutorial, you can import \nWord Count Demo\n\nfrom AppHub. The \nWord Count Demo\n Application Package contains the\nTopNWordsWithQueries Application.\n\n\n\n\nStep I: Add files to the monitored directory\n\n\nTo add the files to the monitored input directory\n\n\n\n\nLog on to the Datatorrent Console (the default username and password are\n   both \ndtadmin\n).\n\n\nOn the top navigation bar, click \nMonitor\n.\n\n\nClick TopNWordsWithQueries to see a page with four tabs: \nlogical\n,\n   \nphysical\n, \nphysical-dag-view\n, and  \nmetric-view\n.\n\n\nClick the \nlogical\n tab and make sure that the DAG is visible.\n\n\nCreate the input and output directories in HDFS and drop a file into the\n   input directory by running the following commands:\nhdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tmp/test/input-dir\nhdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tmp/test/output-dir\nhdfs dfs -put ~/data/rfc4844.txt /tmp/test/input-dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see some numbers above and below some of the operators as the\nlines of the file are read and tuples start flowing through the DAG.\n\n\nYou can view the top 10 words and the frequencies for each input file by\nexamining the corresponding output file in the output directory, for example:\n\n\nhdfs dfs -cat /tmp/test/output-dir/rfc4844.txt\n\n\n\nFor operating on these input and output directories, you may find the following\nshell aliases and functions useful:\n\n\nin=/tmp/test/input-dir\nout=/tmp/test/output-dir\nalias ls-input=\"hdfs dfs -ls $in\"\nalias ls-output=\"hdfs dfs -ls $out\"\nalias clean-input=\"hdfs dfs -rm $in/\\*\"\nalias clean-output=\"hdfs dfs -rm $out/\\*\"\nfunction put-file ( ) {\n    hdfs dfs -put \"$1\" \"$in\"\n}\nfunction get-file ( ) {\n    hdfs dfs -get \"$out/$1\" \"$1\".out\n}\n\n\n\nPut them in a file called, say, \naliases\n and read them into your shell with:\n\nsource aliases\n.\n\n\nThereafter, you can list contents of the input and output directories with\n\nls-input\n and \nls-output\n, remove all files from them with \nclean-input\n and\n\nclean-output\n, drop an input file \nfoo.txt\n into the input directory with\n\nput-file foo.txt\n and finally, retrieve the corresponding output file with\n\nget-file foo.txt\n.\n\n\nNote\n: When you list files in the output directory, their sizes might show as\n0 but if you retrieve them with get-file or catenate them, the expected output\nwill be present.\n\n\nStep II: Visualize the results by generating dashboards\n\n\nTo generate dashboards\n\n\n\n\nPerform step I above.\n\n\nMake sure that the logical tab is selected and the \nApplication Overview\n\n  panel is visible.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nvisualize\n to see a dropdown containing previously created dashboards\n (if any), as well as the \ngenerate new dashboard\n entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \ngenerate new dashboard\n entry.\n\n\nYou should now see panels with charts where one chart displays the data for\nthe current file and a second chart displays the cumulative global data\nacross all files processed so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd more files, one at a time, to the input directory as described in\n  step I above.\n\n\n\n\nObserve the charts changing to reflect the new data.\n\n\n\n\nYou can create multiple dashboards in this manner for visualizing the output\nfrom different applications or from the same application in different ways.\n\n\nStep III: Add widgets\n\n\nTo derive more value out of application dashboards, you can add widgets to the\ndashboards. Widgets are charts in addition to the default charts that you can see on the dashboard. DataTorrent RTS Sandbox supports 5 widgets: \nbar chart\n,\n\npie chart\n, \nhorizontal bar chart\n, \ntable\n, and \nnote\n.\n\n\nTo add a widget\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a dashboard by following instructions of Step II above.\n\n\nClick the \nadd widget\n button below the name of the dashboard.\n\n\nIn the \nData Source\n list, select a data source for your widget.\n\n\n\n\nSelect a widget type under \nAvailable Widgets\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nadd widget\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe widget is added to your dashboard.\n\n\nStep IV: Configure a widget\n\n\nAfter you add a widget to your dashboard, you can configure it at any\ntime. Each widget has a title that appears in gray. If you hover over\nthe title, the pointer changes to a hand.\n\n\nTo configure a widget\n\n\n\n\nTo change the size of the widget, click the border of the widget, and\n  resize it.\n\n\nTo move the widget around, click the widget, and drag it to the desired\n  position.\n\n\nTo change the title and other properties, click the \nedit\n button in the\n  top-right corner of the widget.\n    \n\n  You can now enter a new title in the \nTitle\n box or configure the rest of the\n  options in any suitable way.\n\n\nClick \nOK\n.\n\n\nTo remove a widget, click the delete (x) button in the top-right corner of\n  the widget.\n\n\n\n\nPerform additional tasks on dashboards\n\n\nAt any time, you can change the name and the description of a dashboard. You\ncan also delete dashboards.\n\n\nTo perform additional tasks\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you generated a dashboard as described in Step II above and\n   select it.\n\n\nClick \nsettings\n button (next to buttons named \nadd widget\n,\n   \nauto generate\n, and \nsave settings\n), below the name of the dashboard to see the \nDashboard Settings\n dialog:\n    \n\n\nType a new name for the dashboard in the \nName of dashboard\n box.\n\n\nType a suitable description in the box below.\n\n\nMake sure that \nTopNWordsWithQueries\n is selected under \nChoose apps to\n    visualize\n.\n\n\nClick \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\nDelete a dashboard\n\n\nYou can delete a dashboard at any time.\n\n\n\n\nLog on to the DataTorrent Console (default username and password are both\n  \ndtadmin\n)\n\n\nOn the top navigation bar, click \nVisualize\n.\n\n\n\n\nSelect a dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick delete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The delete button becomes visible only if one or more rows are selected.",

            "text": "Top N Words (Advanced)\n\n\nThis section touches on some advanced features of the RTS platform in the context of the\n\nTop N Words\n application. Accordingly, readers are expected to be familiar with the material\nof the preceding sections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first topic we'd like to discuss is partitioning of operators to increase performance.\nHowever, partitioning increases the memory footprint of the application, so it is important\nto know how to allocate available memory to containers especially in a limited environment\nlike a sandbox. So we begin with a brief discussion of that topic.\n\n\nManaging Memory Allocation for Containers\n\n\nIn this chapter we describe how to monitor and manage the amount of memory allocated to the\ncontainers comprising the application. This is useful in an environment where the needs of\nthe application begins to equal or exceed the memory resources of the cluster.\n\n\nRecall the following facts from the earlier sections:\n\n\n\n\nA container (JVM process) can host multiple operators.\n\n\nThe memory requirements for an operator can be specified via a properties file.\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, here is the application DAG:\n\n\n\nIf we look at the information displayed in the physical tab of \ndtManage\n for the memory\nallocated to each container, we see something like this (the actual container id will most\nlikely be different each time the application is relaunched but the rest of the information\nshould be the same):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainer Id\n\n\nAllocated Memory\n\n\nHosted Operators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 GB\n\n\nNone (AppMaster)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n768 MB\n\n\nsnapshotServerGlobal, QueryGlobal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n768 MB\n\n\nsnapshotServerFile, QueryFile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n128 MB\n\n\nwsResultGlobal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n640 MB\n\n\nwindowWordCount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n128 MB\n\n\nConsole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n128 MB\n\n\nwsResultFile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n640 MB\n\n\nwordReader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n128 MB\n\n\nwcWriter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.4 GB\n\n\nlineReader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n1.9 GB\n\n\nfileWordCount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we now look closely at column 2 (Allocated Memory) we notice some\nunexpected values, for example, the value for the App Master container should have\nbeen 300 MB since we had 300 as the value in the \nproperties.xml\n file for\n\ndt.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB\n. The discrepancy is due to the fact that the file\n\n.dt/dt-site.xml\n in the home directory of user \ndtadmin\n has a value of 1024 for\nthis key which overrides the application specified value.\n\n\nLooking now at container 2, we notice that it hosts 2 operators: \nsnapshotServerGlobal\n\nand \nQueryGlobal\n and each has a value of 128 MB specified in the application properties\nfile; so why is the value 768 MB ? Turns out that each output port of an operator\n\nconnected to another operator outside the container\n\nalso has an associated \nbuffer-server\n which buffers tuples exiting the output port\nto provide fault-tolerance. The buffer server is discussed in detail in\n\nApplication Development\n.\nThe space allocated to the buffer server is governed by properties of the form:\n\n\ndt.application.app-name.operator.op-name.port.port-name.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n\n\n\nwhere \napp-name\n, \nop-name\n and \nport-name\n can be replaced by the appropriate\napplication, operator and port name respectively or by a wildcard (\n*\n). The\ndefault value is 512 MB. Of the two operators, only one (\nsnapshotServerGlobal\n)\nhas an output port connected externally so there\nis only one buffer-server involved which then explains the value of\n768 (= 512 + 128 + 128).\n\n\nThe values for \nwsResultGlobal\n, \nConsole\n, \nwsResultFile\n, \nwcWriter\n are, as\nexpected, 128 MB \n since no output ports are involved, there is no buffer-server.\nThe values for \nwindowWordCount\n and \nwordReader\n are also the expected values\nsince a single buffer-server is involved: 640 = 512 + 128. The value of 1.9 GB\nfor \nfileWordCount\n is obtained as follows: it has 3 buffer-servers since there\nare 3 output ports connected externally; our properties file setting requests\n300 MB for this operator which gives us a total of 3 * 512 + 300 = 1836 MB which\napproximates the value shown. The value for \nlineReader\n can be computed\nsimilarly.\n\n\nThe total amount of allocated space shown on the GUI is 6.5 GB. We can substantially\nreduce the memory footprint further by make a couple changes to attributes:\nCreate a new file named, say, \nlow-mem.xml\n at \nsrc/site/conf/\n with this content:\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n512\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.*.port.*.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n128\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nWe will use this file at launch time.\n\n\nThe BUFFER_MEMORY_MB attribute changes the memory allocation per buffer server\nto 128 MB (from the default of 512 MB).\n\n\nThe MASTER_MEMORY_MB attribute change sets the memory allocated to the Application Master\nto 512 MB and is required for a rather obscure\nreason: The existing value of 300 MB in \nMETA-INF/properties.xml\n\nis actually overridden by the setting of 1024 MB for this parameter in\n\n~dtadmin/.dt/dt-site.xml\n; however, if we use a launch-time configuration file,\nvalues in it override those in \ndt-site.xml\n. A value of 300 is too\nsmall even for simple applications; in normal use and we rarely see a case, even in production,\nwhere a value larger than 1024 MB is needed, though it is possible if the number of\noperators is large. If the App Master runs out of memory,\nyou'll see messages like this in the corresponding log file (see \nDebugging\n\nsection below):\n\n\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded.\n\n\n\nRebuild the application, upload the package and use this file at launch time:\n\n\n\nThe allocated memory shown in the \"Application Overview\" panel should now drop\nto around 3.1GB.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nOn the sandbox, various log files generated by YARN and Hadoop are located at\n\n/sfw/hadoop/shared/logs\n; the \nnodemanager\n directory has application specific\ndirectories with names like this: \napplication_1448033276100_0001\n within\nwhich there are container specific directories with names like\n\ncontainer_1448033276100_0001_01_000001\n. The App Master container has the \n000001\n\nsuffix and the corresponding directory will have these files:\n\n\nAppMaster.stderr  AppMaster.stdout  dt.log\n\n\n\nThe remaining container directories will have files:\n\n\ndt.log  stderr  stdout\n\n\n\nWhen problems occur, all these log files should be carefully examined. For example, the\n\ndt.log\n file contains the entire classpath used to launch each container; if an error\noccurs because a particular class is not found, you can check the classpath to ensure\nthat the appropriate jar file is included. It also shows the command line used to\nlaunch each container with lines like this:\n\n\n2015-12-20 14:31:43,896 INFO com.datatorrent.stram.LaunchContainerRunnable: Launching on node: localhost:8052 command: $JAVA_HOME/bin/java  -Xmx234881024  -Ddt.attr.APPLICATION_PATH=hdfs://localhost:9000/user/dtadmin/datatorrent/apps/application_1450648156272_0001 -Djava.io.tmpdir=$PWD/tmp -Ddt.cid=container_1450648156272_0001_01_000002 -Dhadoop.root.logger=INFO,RFA -Dhadoop.log.dir=\n com.datatorrent.stram.engine.StreamingContainer 1\n/stdout 2\n/stderr\n\n\nYou can provide your own \nlog4j\n configuration file called, say, \nlog4j.properties\n and place\nit in the directory \nsrc/main/resources\n as described in the\n\nconfiguration\n\npage. Alternatively, if you want to change the log level of a particular class or package\nfrom, say \nINFO\n to \nDEBUG\n while the application is running, you can click on the blue\n\nset logging level\n button in the \nApplication Overview\n panel of \ndtManage\n. It will then\ndisplay a dialog window where you can enter the name of the class or package and the desired\nlog level:\n\n\n\n\nNormally, the GUI can be used to navigate to the appropriate container page\nand log files examined from the \nlogs\n dropdown but sometimes using the commandline\nfrom a terminal window may be easier.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\nPartitioning is a mechanism to eliminate bottlenecks in your application and increase\nthroughput. If an operator is performing a resource intensive operation, it risks\nbecoming a bottleneck as the rate of incoming tuples increases. One way to cope\nis to replicate the operator as many times as necessary so that the load is\nevenly distributed across the replicas, thus eliminating the bottleneck. Of course,\nthis technique assumes that your cluster has adequate resources (CPU, memory and\nnetwork bandwidth) to support all the replicas.\n\n\nWithout partitioning, the DAG shown in the \nlogical\n and \nphysical-dag-view\n tabs\nwill be the same.\nHowever, once partitioning is triggered, the latter will show multiple copies of the\npartitioned operator, as well as a new operator immediately\ndownstream of all the copies, called a \nunifier\n. The job of the unifier is to join the\nresults emitted by all the copies, collate them in some application-specific way and\nemit the result just as it would have been emitted if no partitioning were involved.\nThe unifier can either be one that is custom-written for the needs of the application\nor a pass-through platform-generated one.\n\n\nFor our word counting example, we illustrate the technique by partitioning the \nwordReader\n\noperator into 2 copies. For operators that do not maintain state, partitioning does\nnot require additional code: We can simply set a couple of properties -- one to use\nthe \nStatelessPartitioner\n which is part of Malhar and one to specify the number\nof desired partitions. To do this, copy over the \nlow-mem.xml\n configuration file\nwe created above\nto a new file named \nsimple-partition.xml\n in the same directory and add this stanza to it:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wordReader.attr.PARTITIONER\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:2\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nWhen you build, upload and run the application using this configuration file, the\nphysical-dag-view tab should show the following DAG:\n\n\n\n\nNotice the two copies of \nwordReader\n and the generated unifier. The \nphysical\n tab will\nalso show the containers for these additional operators and their characteristics as well.\n\n\nA slight variation of the above theme occurs often in practice: We would like an entire\nlinear sequence of operators (i.e. a fragment of the DAG) replicated in the same way.\nIn our case, the sequence consists of two operators: \nwordReader\n and the next operator\n\nwindowWordCount\n.

Running the\napplication with this configuration file shows the following physical DAG:\n\n\n\n\nNotice that both operators have been replicated and the unifier added.\n\n\nStreaming Windows and Application Windows\n\n\nOperators receive incoming tuples and emit outgoing tuples within a small temporal window\ncalled a \nstreaming window\n. Its boundaries are marked by calls to \nbeginWindow\n and\n\nendWindow\n within which the platform repeatedly invokes either \nemitTuples\n (for input\nadapters) or \nprocess\n on each input port for output adapters and generic operators.\nThese concepts are discussed in greater detail in the\n\nOperatorGuide\n.\n\n\nFor flexibility in operator and application development, the platform allows users to\nchange the size of the streaming window which is defined as a number of milliseconds.\nIt defaults to 500ms but can be changed by setting the\nvalue of an attribute named STREAMING_WINDOW_SIZE_MILLIS; for example, you can set it\nto 5s with:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.attr.STREAMING_WINDOW_SIZE_MILLIS\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n5000\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a very common change but one reason for doing it might be if the stream is\nvery sparse, i.e. the number of incoming tuples in a 500ms window is very small; by\nincreasing the streaming window size, we can substantially reduce the platform bookkeeping\noverhead such as checkpointing.\n\n\nA second attribute is APPLICATION_WINDOW_COUNT; this is a per-operator attribute and is\na count of streaming windows that comprise a single application window. It\ncan be changed with an entry like this (where, as before, \napp-name\n and \nop-name\n should be\nreplaced by either wildcards or names of a specific application and/or operator):\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.app-name.operator.op-name.attr.APPLICATION_WINDOW_COUNT\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n5\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nBy default this value is set to 1 meaning each application window consists of a single\nstreaming window. The the \nbeginWindow\n and \nendWindow\n are invoked once per application\nwindow. A typical reason for increasing this value is when you have an\noperator that is computing aggregates (such as sum, average, maximum, minimum) of one or\nmore fields of the incoming tuples: A larger application window may yield more\nmeaningful aggregates.",

This is useful in an environment where the needs of\nthe application begins to equal or exceed the memory resources of the cluster.  Recall the following facts from the earlier sections:   A container (JVM process) can host multiple operators.  The memory requirements for an operator can be specified via a properties file.   For reference, here is the application DAG:  If we look at the information displayed in the physical tab of  dtManage  for the memory\nallocated to each container, we see something like this (the actual container id will most\nlikely be different each time the application is relaunched but the rest of the information\nshould be the same):          Container Id  Allocated Memory  Hosted Operators    1  1 GB  None (AppMaster)    2  768 MB  snapshotServerGlobal, QueryGlobal    3  768 MB  snapshotServerFile, QueryFile    4  128 MB  wsResultGlobal    5  640 MB  windowWordCount    6  128 MB  Console    7  128 MB  wsResultFile    8  640 MB  wordReader    9  128 MB  wcWriter    10  1.4 GB  lineReader    11  1.9 GB  fileWordCount     If we now look closely at column 2 (Allocated Memory) we notice some\nunexpected values, for example, the value for the App Master container should have\nbeen 300 MB since we had 300 as the value in the  properties.xml  file for dt.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB . The discrepancy is due to the fact that the file .dt/dt-site.xml  in the home directory of user  dtadmin  has a value of 1024 for\nthis key which overrides the application specified value.  Looking now at container 2, we notice that it hosts 2 operators:  snapshotServerGlobal \nand  QueryGlobal  and each has a value of 128 MB specified in the application properties\nfile; so why is the value 768 MB ? Turns out that each output port of an operator connected to another operator outside the container \nalso has an associated  buffer-server  which buffers tuples exiting the output port\nto provide fault-tolerance. The buffer server is discussed in detail in Application Development .\nThe space allocated to the buffer server is governed by properties of the form:  dt.application.app-name.operator.op-name.port.port-name.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB  where  app-name ,  op-name  and  port-name  can be replaced by the appropriate\napplication, operator and port name respectively or by a wildcard ( * ). The\ndefault value is 512 MB. Of the two operators, only one ( snapshotServerGlobal )\nhas an output port connected externally so there\nis only one buffer-server involved which then explains the value of\n768 (= 512 + 128 + 128).  The values for  wsResultGlobal ,  Console ,  wsResultFile ,  wcWriter  are, as\nexpected, 128 MB   since no output ports are involved, there is no buffer-server.\nThe values for  windowWordCount  and  wordReader  are also the expected values\nsince a single buffer-server is involved: 640 = 512 + 128. The value of 1.9 GB\nfor  fileWordCount  is obtained as follows: it has 3 buffer-servers since there\nare 3 output ports connected externally; our properties file setting requests\n300 MB for this operator which gives us a total of 3 * 512 + 300 = 1836 MB which\napproximates the value shown. The value for  lineReader  can be computed\nsimilarly.  The total amount of allocated space shown on the GUI is 6.5 GB. We can substantially\nreduce the memory footprint further by make a couple changes to attributes:\nCreate a new file named, say,  low-mem.xml  at  src/site/conf/  with this content:  configuration \n   property \n     name dt.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB /name \n     value 512 /value \n   /property   property \n     name dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.*.port.*.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB /name \n     value 128 /value \n   /property  /configuration   We will use this file at launch time.  The BUFFER_MEMORY_MB attribute changes the memory allocation per buffer server\nto 128 MB (from the default of 512 MB).  The MASTER_MEMORY_MB attribute change sets the memory allocated to the Application Master\nto 512 MB and is required for a rather obscure\nreason: The existing value of 300 MB in  META-INF/properties.xml \nis actually overridden by the setting of 1024 MB for this parameter in ~dtadmin/.dt/dt-site.xml ; however, if we use a launch-time configuration file,\nvalues in it override those in  dt-site.xml . A value of 300 is too\nsmall even for simple applications; in normal use and we rarely see a case, even in production,\nwhere a value larger than 1024 MB is needed, though it is possible if the number of\noperators is large. If the App Master runs out of memory,\nyou'll see messages like this in the corresponding log file (see  Debugging \nsection below):  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded.  Rebuild the application, upload the package and use this file at launch time:  The allocated memory shown in the \"Application Overview\" panel should now drop\nto around 3.1GB.",

            "text": "Partitioning is a mechanism to eliminate bottlenecks in your application and increase\nthroughput. If an operator is performing a resource intensive operation, it risks\nbecoming a bottleneck as the rate of incoming tuples increases. One way to cope\nis to replicate the operator as many times as necessary so that the load is\nevenly distributed across the replicas, thus eliminating the bottleneck. Of course,\nthis technique assumes that your cluster has adequate resources (CPU, memory and\nnetwork bandwidth) to support all the replicas.  Without partitioning, the DAG shown in the  logical  and  physical-dag-view  tabs\nwill be the same.\nHowever, once partitioning is triggered, the latter will show multiple copies of the\npartitioned operator, as well as a new operator immediately\ndownstream of all the copies, called a  unifier . The job of the unifier is to join the\nresults emitted by all the copies, collate them in some application-specific way and\nemit the result just as it would have been emitted if no partitioning were involved.\nThe unifier can either be one that is custom-written for the needs of the application\nor a pass-through platform-generated one.  For our word counting example, we illustrate the technique by partitioning the  wordReader \noperator into 2 copies. For operators that do not maintain state, partitioning does\nnot require additional code: We can simply set a couple of properties -- one to use\nthe  StatelessPartitioner  which is part of Malhar and one to specify the number\nof desired partitions. To do this, copy over the  low-mem.xml  configuration file\nwe created above\nto a new file named  simple-partition.xml  in the same directory and add this stanza to it:  property \n   name dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wordReader.attr.PARTITIONER /name \n   value com.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:2 /value  /property   When you build, upload and run the application using this configuration file, the\nphysical-dag-view tab should show the following DAG:   Notice the two copies of  wordReader  and the generated unifier. The  physical  tab will\nalso show the containers for these additional operators and their characteristics as well.  A slight variation of the above theme occurs often in practice: We would like an entire\nlinear sequence of operators (i.e. a fragment of the DAG) replicated in the same way.\nIn our case, the sequence consists of two operators:  wordReader  and the next operator windowWordCount . To accomplish this, again no additional code is required: We can simply\nadd this stanza to our properties file:  property \n   name dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.windowWordCount.inputport.input.attr.PARTITION_PARALLEL /name \n   value true /value  /property   It enables the PARTITION_PARALLEL attribute on the  input port  of the downstream operator,\nthus indicating to the platform that the downstream operator must be partitioned into just\nas many copies as the upstream operator so that they form parallel pipelines.

First, the operators are created and added to\nthe DAG via the \naddOperator\n method:\n\n\nLineReader lineReader = dag.addOperator(\nlineReader\n,new LineReader());\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is a string that names this instance of the\noperator; it is the same as the value in the first column of the above\ntable and also the node name in the Logical DAG.\n\n\nNext, we connect each output port of an operator with all the input ports that\nshould receive these tuples using the \naddStream\n function, for example:\n\n\ndag.addStream(\nlines\n, lineReader.output, wordReader.input);\n...\ndag.addStream(\nWordCountsFile\n, fileWordCount.outputPerFile, snapshotServerFile.input, console.input);\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the stream from \nfileWordCount.outputPerFile\n (which consists of\nthe top N words for the current file as the file is being read) goes to\n\nsnapshotServerFile.input\n (where it will be saved to respond to queries) and to\n\nconsole.input\n (which is used for debugging). Additional sinks can be provided\nin the same call as additional terminal arguments. You can examine the rest of\nthese calls and ensure that they match the names and connections of the\nLogical DAG.\n\n\nThis section provides detailed information about each operator.\n\n\nLineReader\n\n\nThis class extends \nAbstractFileInputOperator\nString\n to open a file, read its\nlines, and emit them as tuples. It has two output ports, one for the normal\noutput of tuples, and the other for the output of an EOF tuple indicating the\nend of the current input file. Ports should always be transient fields because\nthey should not be serialized and saved to the disk during checkpointing.\n\n\nThe base class keeps track of files already processed, files that\nshould be ignored, and files that failed part-way. Derived classes need to\noverride four methods: \nopenFile\n, \ncloseFile\n, \nreadEntity\n, and \nemit\n. Of\nthese, only the third is non-trivial: if a valid line is available, it is read\nand returned. Otherwise, the end of the file must have been reached. To\nindicate this, the file name is emitted on the control port where it\nwill be read by the \nFileWordCount\n operator.\n\n\nWordReader\n\n\nThis operator receives lines from \nLineReader\n on the input port and emits\nwords on the output port. It has a configurable property called \nnonWordStr\n\nalong with associated public getter and setter methods. Such properties can be\ncustomized in the appropriate properties file of the application. The values of\nthe properties are automatically injected into the operator at run-time. In\nthis scenario, this string is provided the value of the property\n\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wordReader.nonWordStr\n.\nFor efficiency, this string is compiled into a pattern for repeated use.\nThe \nprocess\n method of the input port splits each input line into words using\nthis pattern as the separator, and emits non-empty words on the output port.\n\n\nWindowWordCount\n\n\nThis operator receives words and emits a list of word-frequency pairs for each\nwindow. It maintains a word-frequency map for the current window, updates this\nmap for each word received, emits the whole map (if non-empty) when\n\nendWindow\n is called, and clears the map in preparation for the next window.\nThis design pattern is appropriate because for normal text files, the number of\nwords received is far more than the size of the accumulated map. However, for\nsituations where data is emitted for each tuple, you should not wait till the\n\nendWindow\n call, but rather emit output tuples as each input tuple is\nprocessed.\n\n\nFileWordCount\n\n\nThis operator has two input ports, one for the per-window frequency maps it\ngets from the previous operator, and a control port to receive the file name\nwhen \nLineReader\n reaches the end of a file. When a file name is received on\nthe control port, it is saved and the final results for the file appear as\noutput at the next \nendWindow\n. The reason for waiting is subtle: there is no\nguarantee of the relative order in which tuples arrive at two input ports;\nadditional input tuples from the same window can arrive at the input port\neven after the EOF was received on the control port. Note however that we \ndo\n\nhave a guarantee that tuples on the input port will arrive in exactly the same\norder in which they were emitted on the output port between the bracketing\n\nbeginWindow\n and \nendWindow\n calls by the upstream operator.\n\n\nThis operator also has three output ports: the \noutputPerFile\n port for the top\nN pairs for the current file as it is being read; the \noutputGlobal\n port for\nthe global top N pairs, and the \nfileOutput\n port for the final top N pairs for\nthe current file computed after receiving the EOF control tuple. The output\nfrom the first is sent to the per-file snapshot server, the output from\nthe second is sent to the global snapshot server, and the output from the last\nis sent to the operator that writes results to the output file.\n\n\nFileWordCount\n also maintains two maps for per-file and global frequency\ncounts because they track frequencies of all words seen so far. These maps\ncan get very large as more and more files are processed.\n\n\nFileWordCount\n has a configurable property \ntopN\n for the number of top pairs we\nare interested in. This was configured in our properties file with a value of\n10 and the property name: \ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.fileWordCount.topN\n\n\nIn the \nendWindow\n call, both maps are passed to the \ngetTopNList\n function\nwhere they are flattened, sorted in descending order of frequency, stripped of\nall but the top N pairs, and returned for output. There are a couple of\nadditional fields used to cast the output into the somewhat peculiar form\nrequired by the snapshot server.\n\n\nWordCountWriter\n\n\nThis operator extends \nAbstractFileOutputOperator\nMap\nString,Object\n, and\nsimply writes the final top N pairs to the output file. As with \nLineReader\n,\nmost of the complexity of \nWordCountWriter\n is hidden in the base class. You must\nprovide implementations for 3 methods: \nendWindow\n, \ngetFileName\n, and\n\ngetBytesForTuple\n. The first method calls the base class method \nrequestFinalize\n.\nThe output file is written periodically to temporary files\nwith a synthetic file name that includes a timestamp. These files are removed\nand the actual desired file name is restored by this call. The \ngetFileName\n\nmethod retrieves the file name from the tuple, and the \ngetBytesForTuple\n\nmethod converts the list of pairs to a string in the desired format.\n\n\nConsoleOutputOperator\n\n\nThis is an output operator that is a part of the Malhar library. It simply\nwrites incoming tuples to the console and is useful when debugging.\n\n\nAppDataSnapshotServerMap\n\n\nThis operator is also part of the Malhar library and is used to store snapshots\nof data. These snapshots are used to respond to queries. For this application,\nwe use two snapshots \n  one for a per-file top N snapshot and one for a\nglobal snapshot.\n\n\nPubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery\n\n\nThis is an input operator that is a part of the Malhar library. It is used to\nsend queries to an operator via the Data Torrent Gateway, which can act as a\nmessage broker for limited amounts of data using a topic-based\npublish-subscribe model. The URL to connect is typically something like:\n\n\nws://gateway-host:port/pubsub\n\n\n\n\nwhere \ngateway-host\n and \nport\n should be replaced by appropriate values.\n\n\nA publisher sends a JSON message to the URL where the value of the \ndata\n key\nis the desired message content. The JSON might look like this:\n\n\n{\ntype\n:\npublish\n, \ntopic\n:\nfoobar\n, \ndata\n: ...}\n\n\n\n\nCorrespondingly, subscribers send messages like this to retrieve published\nmessage data:\n\n\n{\ntype\n:\nsubscribe\n, \ntopic\n:\nfoobar\n}\n\n\n\n\nTopic names need not be pre-registered anywhere but the same topic\nname (for example, \nfoobar\n in the example) must be used by both publisher and\nsubscriber. Additionally, if there are no subscribers when a message is\npublished, it is simply discarded.\n\n\nFor this tutorial, two query operators are used: one for per-file queries and\none for global queries. The topic names were configured in the properties file\nearlier with values \nTopNWordsQueryFile\n and \nTopNWordsQueryGlobal\n under the\nrespective names:\n\n\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.QueryFile.topic\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.QueryGlobal.topic\n\n\n\n\nPubSubWebSocketAppDataResult\n\n\nAnalogous to the previous operator, this is an output operator used to publish\nquery results to a gateway topic. You must use two of these to match the query\noperators, and configure their topics in the properties file with values\n\nTopNWordsQueryFileResult\n and \nTopNWordsQueryGlobalResult\n corresponding to\nthe respective names:\n\n\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wsResultFile.topic\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wsResultGlobal.topic\n\n\n\n\nFurther Exploration\n\n\nIn this tutorial, the property values in the \nproperties.xml\n file were set to\nlimit the amount of memory allocated to each operator. You can try varying\nthese values and checking the impact of such an operation on the stability and\nperformance of the application. You can also explore the largest text\nfile that the application can handle.\n\n\nAnother aspect to explore is fixing the current limitation of\none-file-at-a-time processing; if multiple files are dropped into the\ninput directory simultaneously, the file reader can switch from one file to the\nnext in the same window.

            "text": "This section describes the operators used for building the top N\nwords application. The operators, the implementing classes and a brief description of their\nfunctionalities are described in this table.          Operator  Implementing class  Description    lineReader  LineReader  Reads lines from input files.    wordReader  WordReader  Splits a line into words.    windowWordCount  WindowWordCount  Computes word frequencies for a single window.    fileWordCount  FileWordCount  Maintains per-file and global word frequencies.    wcWriter  WcWriter  Writes top N words and their frequencies to output files.    console  ConsoleOutputOperator  Writes received tuples to console.    snapshotServerFile  AppDataSnapshotServerMap  Caches the last data set for the current file, and returns it in response to queries.    snapshotServerGlobal  AppDataSnapshotServerMap  Caches the last global data set, and returns it in response to queries.    QueryFile  PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery  Receives queries for per-file data.    QueryGlobal  PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery  Receives queries for global data.    wsResultFile  PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult  Returns results for per-file queries.    wsResultGlobal  PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult  Returns results for global queries.     We now describe the process of wiring these operators together in the populateDAG()  method of the main application class ApplicationWithQuerySupport . First, the operators are created and added to\nthe DAG via the  addOperator  method:  LineReader lineReader = dag.addOperator( lineReader ,new LineReader());  The first argument is a string that names this instance of the\noperator; it is the same as the value in the first column of the above\ntable and also the node name in the Logical DAG.  Next, we connect each output port of an operator with all the input ports that\nshould receive these tuples using the  addStream  function, for example:  dag.addStream( lines , lineReader.output, wordReader.input);\n...\ndag.addStream( WordCountsFile , fileWordCount.outputPerFile, snapshotServerFile.input, console.input);  Notice that the stream from  fileWordCount.outputPerFile  (which consists of\nthe top N words for the current file as the file is being read) goes to snapshotServerFile.input  (where it will be saved to respond to queries) and to console.input  (which is used for debugging). Additional sinks can be provided\nin the same call as additional terminal arguments. You can examine the rest of\nthese calls and ensure that they match the names and connections of the\nLogical DAG.  This section provides detailed information about each operator.  LineReader  This class extends  AbstractFileInputOperator String  to open a file, read its\nlines, and emit them as tuples. It has two output ports, one for the normal\noutput of tuples, and the other for the output of an EOF tuple indicating the\nend of the current input file. Ports should always be transient fields because\nthey should not be serialized and saved to the disk during checkpointing.  The base class keeps track of files already processed, files that\nshould be ignored, and files that failed part-way. Derived classes need to\noverride four methods:  openFile ,  closeFile ,  readEntity , and  emit . Of\nthese, only the third is non-trivial: if a valid line is available, it is read\nand returned. Otherwise, the end of the file must have been reached. To\nindicate this, the file name is emitted on the control port where it\nwill be read by the  FileWordCount  operator.  WordReader  This operator receives lines from  LineReader  on the input port and emits\nwords on the output port. It has a configurable property called  nonWordStr \nalong with associated public getter and setter methods. Such properties can be\ncustomized in the appropriate properties file of the application. The values of\nthe properties are automatically injected into the operator at run-time. In\nthis scenario, this string is provided the value of the property dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wordReader.nonWordStr .\nFor efficiency, this string is compiled into a pattern for repeated use.\nThe  process  method of the input port splits each input line into words using\nthis pattern as the separator, and emits non-empty words on the output port.  WindowWordCount  This operator receives words and emits a list of word-frequency pairs for each\nwindow. It maintains a word-frequency map for the current window, updates this\nmap for each word received, emits the whole map (if non-empty) when endWindow  is called, and clears the map in preparation for the next window.\nThis design pattern is appropriate because for normal text files, the number of\nwords received is far more than the size of the accumulated map. However, for\nsituations where data is emitted for each tuple, you should not wait till the endWindow  call, but rather emit output tuples as each input tuple is\nprocessed.  FileWordCount  This operator has two input ports, one for the per-window frequency maps it\ngets from the previous operator, and a control port to receive the file name\nwhen  LineReader  reaches the end of a file. When a file name is received on\nthe control port, it is saved and the final results for the file appear as\noutput at the next  endWindow . The reason for waiting is subtle: there is no\nguarantee of the relative order in which tuples arrive at two input ports;\nadditional input tuples from the same window can arrive at the input port\neven after the EOF was received on the control port. Note however that we  do \nhave a guarantee that tuples on the input port will arrive in exactly the same\norder in which they were emitted on the output port between the bracketing beginWindow  and  endWindow  calls by the upstream operator.  This operator also has three output ports: the  outputPerFile  port for the top\nN pairs for the current file as it is being read; the  outputGlobal  port for\nthe global top N pairs, and the  fileOutput  port for the final top N pairs for\nthe current file computed after receiving the EOF control tuple. The output\nfrom the first is sent to the per-file snapshot server, the output from\nthe second is sent to the global snapshot server, and the output from the last\nis sent to the operator that writes results to the output file.  FileWordCount  also maintains two maps for per-file and global frequency\ncounts because they track frequencies of all words seen so far. These maps\ncan get very large as more and more files are processed.  FileWordCount  has a configurable property  topN  for the number of top pairs we\nare interested in. This was configured in our properties file with a value of\n10 and the property name:  dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.fileWordCount.topN  In the  endWindow  call, both maps are passed to the  getTopNList  function\nwhere they are flattened, sorted in descending order of frequency, stripped of\nall but the top N pairs, and returned for output. There are a couple of\nadditional fields used to cast the output into the somewhat peculiar form\nrequired by the snapshot server.  WordCountWriter  This operator extends  AbstractFileOutputOperator Map String,Object , and\nsimply writes the final top N pairs to the output file. As with  LineReader ,\nmost of the complexity of  WordCountWriter  is hidden in the base class. You must\nprovide implementations for 3 methods:  endWindow ,  getFileName , and getBytesForTuple . The first method calls the base class method  requestFinalize .\nThe output file is written periodically to temporary files\nwith a synthetic file name that includes a timestamp. These files are removed\nand the actual desired file name is restored by this call. The  getFileName \nmethod retrieves the file name from the tuple, and the  getBytesForTuple \nmethod converts the list of pairs to a string in the desired format.  ConsoleOutputOperator  This is an output operator that is a part of the Malhar library. It simply\nwrites incoming tuples to the console and is useful when debugging.  AppDataSnapshotServerMap  This operator is also part of the Malhar library and is used to store snapshots\nof data. These snapshots are used to respond to queries. For this application,\nwe use two snapshots    one for a per-file top N snapshot and one for a\nglobal snapshot.  PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery  This is an input operator that is a part of the Malhar library. It is used to\nsend queries to an operator via the Data Torrent Gateway, which can act as a\nmessage broker for limited amounts of data using a topic-based\npublish-subscribe model. The URL to connect is typically something like:  ws://gateway-host:port/pubsub  where  gateway-host  and  port  should be replaced by appropriate values.  A publisher sends a JSON message to the URL where the value of the  data  key\nis the desired message content. The JSON might look like this:  { type : publish ,  topic : foobar ,  data : ...}  Correspondingly, subscribers send messages like this to retrieve published\nmessage data:  { type : subscribe ,  topic : foobar }  Topic names need not be pre-registered anywhere but the same topic\nname (for example,  foobar  in the example) must be used by both publisher and\nsubscriber. Additionally, if there are no subscribers when a message is\npublished, it is simply discarded.  For this tutorial, two query operators are used: one for per-file queries and\none for global queries. The topic names were configured in the properties file\nearlier with values  TopNWordsQueryFile  and  TopNWordsQueryGlobal  under the\nrespective names:  dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.QueryFile.topic\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.QueryGlobal.topic  PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult  Analogous to the previous operator, this is an output operator used to publish\nquery results to a gateway topic. You must use two of these to match the query\noperators, and configure their topics in the properties file with values TopNWordsQueryFileResult  and  TopNWordsQueryGlobalResult  corresponding to\nthe respective names:  dt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wsResultFile.topic\ndt.application.TopNWordsWithQueries.operator.wsResultGlobal.topic",

Another aspect to explore is fixing the current limitation of\none-file-at-a-time processing; if multiple files are dropped into the\ninput directory simultaneously, the file reader can switch from one file to the\nnext in the same window.

Thus, operators and ports\nare at the heart of all applications. The \nOperator\n interface extends the \nComponent\n\ninterface:\n\n\npublic interface Component \nCONTEXT extends Context\n {\n  public void setup(CONTEXT cntxt);\n  public void teardown();\n}\n\n\n\nThe \nOperator\n interface defines \nPort\n, \nInputPort\n, and \nOutputPort\n as inner interfaces with\n\nInputPort\n, and \nOutputPort\n extending \nPort\n.\n\n\npublic interface Operator extends Component\nContext.OperatorContext\n {\n\n  public static interface Port extends Component\nContext.PortContext\n {}\n\n  public static interface InputPort\nT extends Object\n extends Port {\n    public Sink\nT\n getSink();\n    public void setConnected(boolean bln);\n    public StreamCodec\nT\n getStreamCodec();\n  }\n\n  public static interface OutputPort\nT extends Object\n extends Port {\n    public void setSink(Sink\nObject\n sink);\n    public Unifier\nT\n getUnifier();\n  }\n\n  public void beginWindow(long l);\n  public void endWindow();\n}\n\n\n\nOperators typically extend the \nBaseOperator\n class which simply\ndefines empty methods for \nsetup\n, \nteardown\n, \nbeginWindow\n, and\n\nendWindow\n. Derived classes only need to define those functions for\nwhich they want to perform an action. For example the\n\nConsoleOutputOperator\n class, which is often used during testing and\ndebugging, does not override any of these methods.\n\n\nInput operators typically receive data from some external source such\nas a database, message broker, or a file system. They might also\ncreate synthetic data internally. They then transform this data into\none or more events and write these events on one or more output ports;\nthey have no input ports (this might seem paradoxical at first, but is\nconsistent with our usage of input ports that dictates that input\nports only be used to receive data from other operators, not from an\nexternal source).\n\n\nInput ports must implement the \nInputOperator\n interface.\n\n\npublic interface InputOperator extends Operator {\n  public void emitTuples();\n}\n\n\n\nThe \nemitTuples\n method will typically output one or more events on\nsome or all of the output ports defined in the operator. For example,\nthe simple application generated by the maven archetype command\ndiscussed earlier has an operator named \nRandomNumberGenerator\n,\nwhich is defined like this:\n\n\npublic class RandomNumberGenerator extends BaseOperator implements InputOperator {\n\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nDouble\n out = new DefaultOutputPort\nDouble\n();\n\n  public void emitTuples()  {\n    if (count++ \n 100) {\n      out.emit(Math.random());\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFinally, the \nDefaultInputPort\n and \nDefaultOutputPort\n classes are\nvery useful as base classes that can be extended when defining ports\nin operators.\n\n\npublic abstract class DefaultInputPort\nT\n implements InputPort\nT\n, Sink\nT\n {\n  private int count;\n\n  public Sink\nT\n getSink(){ return this; }\n\n  public void put(T tuple){\n    count++;\n    process(tuple);\n  }\n\n  public int getCount(boolean reset) {\n    try {\n      return count;\n    } finally {\n      if (reset) {\n        count = 0;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  public abstract void process(T tuple);\n}\n\npublic class DefaultOutputPort\nT\n implements Operator.OutputPort\nT\n {\n  private transient Sink\nObject\n sink;\n\n  final public void setSink(Sink\nObject\n s) {\n    this.sink = s == null? Sink.BLACKHOLE: s;\n  }\n\n  public void emit(T tuple){\n    sink.put(tuple);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe \nDefaultInputPort\n class automatically keeps track of the number\nof events emitted and also supports the notion of a sink if needed in\nspecial circumstances. The abstract \nprocess\n method needs to be\nimplemented by any concrete derived class; it will be invoked via the\n\nSink.put\n override.\n\n\nThe \nDefaultOutputPort\n class also supports a sink and forwards calls\nto \nemit\n to the sink. The \nsetSink\n method is called by the \nStrAM\n\nexecution engine to inject a suitable sink at deployment time.\n\n\nOutput operators are the opposite of input operators; they typically\nreceive data on one or more input ports from other operators and write\nthem to external sinks. They have no output ports. There is, however,\nno specific interface to implement or base class to extend for output\noperators, though they often end up extending \nBaseOperator\n for\nconvenience. For example, the \nConsoleOutputOperator\n mentioned earlier\nis defined like this:\n\n\npublic class ConsoleOutputOperator extends BaseOperator {\n  public final transient DefaultInputPort\nObject\n input = new DefaultInputPort\nObject\n() {\n    public void process(Object t) {\n      System.out.println(s); }\n    };\n}\n\n\n\nNotice that the implementation of the abstract method\n\nDefaultInputPort.process\n simply writes the argument object to the\nconsole (we have simplified the code in that function somewhat for the\npurposes of this discussion; the actual code also allows the message\nto be logged and also allows some control over the output format).\n\n\nOperators in the Sales Dimensions application\n\n\nThe application simulates an incoming stream of sales events by\ngenerating a synthetic stream of such events; these events are then\nconverted to Java objects, enriched by mapping numeric identifiers to\nmeaningful product names or categories. Aggregated data is then\ncomputed and stored for all possible combinations of dimensions such\nas channels, regions, product categories and customers. Finally, query\nsupport is added to enable visualization. Accordingly, a number of\noperators come into play and they are listed below. Within an\napplication, an operator can be instantiated multiple times; in order\nto distinguish these instances, an application-specific name is\nassociated with each instance (provided as the first argument of the\n\ndag.addoperator\n call). To facilitate easy cross-referencing with the\ncode, we use the actual Java class names in the list below along with\nthe instance name in parentheses.\n\n\nThis diagram represents the Sales Dimension DAG. The\nports on these operators are connected via streams.\n\n\n\nJsonSalesGenerator (InputGenerator)\n\n\nThis class (new operator) is an input operator that generates a single\nsales event defined by a class like this:\n\n\nclass SalesEvent {\n  /* dimension keys */\n  public long time;\n  public int productId;\n  public String customer;\n  public String channel;\n  public String region;\n  /* metrics */\n  public double sales;\n  public double discount;\n  public double tax;\n}\n\n\n\nJsonToMapConverter (Converter)\n\n\nThis operator uses some special utility classes (ObjectReader and\nObjectMapper) to transform JSON event data to Java maps for easy\nmanipulation in Java code; it is fairly simple:\n\n\npublic class JsonToMapConverter extends BaseOperator {\n\n...\n\n  public final transient DefaultInputPort\nbyte\\[\\]\n input = new DefaultInputPort\nbyte[]\n() {\n    public void process(byte\\[\\] message) {\n      Map\nString, Object\n tuple = reader.readValue(message);\n      outputMap.emit(tuple);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n outputMap\n     = new DefaultOutputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n();\n\n}\n\n\n\nEnrichmentOperator (Enrichment)\n\n\nThis operator performs category lookup based on incoming numeric\nproduct IDs and adds the corresponding category names to the output\nevents. The mapping is read from the text file \nproducts.txt\n that\nwe encountered earlier while building the application. It contains\ndata like this:\n\n\n{\"productId\":96,\"product\":\"Printers\"}\n{\"productId\":97,\"product\":\"Routers\"}\n{\"productId\":98,\"product\":\"Smart Phones\"}\n\n\n\nThe core functionality of this operator is in the \nprocess\n function of\nthe input port where it looks up the product identifier in the\nenrichment mapping and adds the result to the event before emitting it\nto the output port. The mapping file can be modified at runtime to add\nor remove productId to category mapping pairs, so there is also some\ncode to check the modification timestamp and re-read the file if necessary.\n\n\npublic class EnrichmentOperator extends BaseOperator {\n  ...\n  public transient DefaultOutputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n\n    outputPort = new DefaultOutputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n();\n\n  public transient DefaultInputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n\n    inputPort = new DefaultInputPort\nMap\nString, Object\n() {\n\n    public void process(Map\nString, Object\n tuple) {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nDimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaMap (DimensionsComputation)\n\n\nThis operator performs dimension computations on incoming data. Sales\nnumbers by all combinations of region, product category, customer, and\nsales channel should be computed and emitted.\n\n\nAppDataSingleDimensionStoreHDHT (Store)\n\n\nThis operator stores computed dimensional information on HDFS,\noptimized for fast retrieval so that it can respond to queries.\n\n\nPubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery (Query)\n\n\nThis is the dashboard connector for visualization queries.\nThis operator and the next are used respectively to send queries and\nretrieve results from the Data Torrent Gateway which can act like a\nmessage broker for limited amounts of data using a topic-based\npublish/subscribe model. The URL to connect to is typically something\nlike \nws://\ngateway-host\n:\nport\n/pubsub\n where\n\ngateway-host\n and \nport\n should be replaced by appropriate values.\n\n\nA publisher sends a JSON message that looks like this to the URL\nwhere the value of the \ndata\n key is the desired message content:\n\n\n{\"type\":\"publish\", \"topic\":\"foobar\", \"data\": ...}\n\n\n\nCorrespondingly, subscribers send messages like this\nto retrieve published message data:\n\n\n{\"type\":\"subscribe\", \"topic\":\"foobar\"}\n\n\n\nTopic names need not be pre-registered anywhere but obviously, the\nsame topic name (e.g. \nfoobar\n in the example above) must be used by both\npublisher and subscriber; additionally, if there are no subscribers when\na message is published, it is simply discarded.\n\n\nThis query operator is an input operator used to send queries from\nthe dashboard to the store via the gateway:\n\n\npublic class PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery extends PubSubWebSocketInputOperator\nString\n\nimplements AppData.ConnectionInfoProvider {\n  ...\n  protected String convertMessage(String message) {\n    JSONObject jo = new JSONObject(message);\n    return jo.getString(\"data\");\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe important method here is \nconvertMessage\n to convert the input\nstring to a JSON object, get the value of the \ndata\n key from the object\nand return it. The base classes look like this:\n\n\npublic class PubSubWebSocketInputOperator\nT\n extends WebSocketInputOperator\nT\n {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nThis class simply converts a JSON event into Java maps via the\n\nconvertMessage\n method.\n\n\npublic class WebSocketInputOperator\nT\n extends\nSimpleSinglePortInputOperator\nT\n implements Runnable {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nThis code is intended to be run in an asynchronous thread to retrieve\nevents from an external source and emit them on the output port.\n\n\npublic abstract class SimpleSinglePortInputOperator\nT\n extends BaseOperator\nimplements InputOperator, Operator.ActivationListener\nOperatorContext\n {\n\n  final public transient BufferingOutputPort\nT\n outputPort;\n\n  final public void activate(OperatorContext ctx) {\n  }\n\n  public void emitTuples() {\n    outputPort.flush(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n  }\n\n  public static class BufferingOutputPort\nT\n extends DefaultOutputPort\nT\n {\n    public void flush(int count) { ... }\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\nThe class starts a separate thread which retrieves source events and\ninvokes the \nemit\n method of the output port; the output port buffers\nevents until the \nflush\n method is called at which point all buffered\nevents are emitted.\n\n\nPubSubWebSocketAppDataResult (QueryResult)\n\n\nThis is the dashboard connector for results of visualization queries\nand is the result counterpart of the previous input query operator:\n\n\npublic class PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult extends PubSubWebSocketOutputOperator\nString\n\nimplements AppData.ConnectionInfoProvider {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nThis class merely overrides the generic \nconvertMapToMessage\n method of the\nbase class to generate the required JSON publish message.\n\n\npublic class PubSubWebSocketOutputOperator\nT\n extends WebSocketOutputOperator\nT\n {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nThis class, similarly, doesn't do much \n the \nconvertMapToMessage\n\nmethod converts input data into a suitable JSON object for publishing to the\nregistered topic.\n\n\npublic class WebSocketOutputOperator\nT\n extends BaseOperator {\n  public final transient DefaultInputPort\nT\n input = new DefaultInputPort\nT\n() {\n    public void process(T t) {\n      ...\n\n      connection.sendTextMessage(convertMapToMessage(t));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe key element in this class is the input port (the rest of the code\ndeals with establishing a connection and reconnecting if\nnecessary). As usual, the key method in the input port is \nprocess\n\nwhich converts the incoming event to a JSON message and sends it\nacross the connection.\n\n\nConnecting the operators\n\n\nNow that we've seen the operator details, we will look at how they are\nconnected in the application. An application must implement the\n\nStreamingApplication\n interface:\n\n\npublic class SalesDemo implements StreamingApplication {\n  ...\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration conf) {\n    JsonSalesGenerator input = dag.addOperator(\"InputGenerator\", JsonSalesGenerator.class);\n    JsonToMapConverter converter = dag.addOperator(\"Converter\", JsonToMapConverter.class);\n    EnrichmentOperator enrichmentOperator = dag.addOperator(\"Enrichment\", EnrichmentOperator.class);\n    DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaMap dimensions = dag.addOperator(\"DimensionsComputation\", DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaMap.class);\n    AppDataSingleSchemaDimensionStoreHDHT store = dag.addOperator(\"Store\", AppDataSingleSchemaDimensionStoreHDHT.class);\n\n    ...\n\n    PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery wsIn = new PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery();\n    wsIn.setTopic(\"SalesDimensionsQuery\");\n    store.setEmbeddableQueryInfoProvider(wsIn);\n\n    PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult wsOut = dag.addOperator(\"QueryResult\", new PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult());\n    wsOut.setTopic(\"SalesDimensionsResult\");\n\n    dag.addStream(\"InputStream\", inputGenerator.getOutputPort(), converter.input);\n    dag.addStream(\"EnrichmentStream\", converter.outputMap, enrichmentOperator.inputPort);\n    dag.addStream(\"ConvertStream\", enrichmentOperator.outputPort, dimensions.input);\n    dag.addStream(\"DimensionalData\", dimensions.output, store.input);\n    dag.addStream(\"QueryResult\", store.queryResult, wsOut.input).setLocality(Locality.CONTAINER_LOCAL);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe key method to implement in an application is \npopulateDAG\n; as shown\nabove, the first step is to create instances of all seven operators and\nadd them to the DAG (we have omitted some parts of the code that are\nrelated to advanced features or are not directly relevant to the\ncurrent discussion). Once the operators are added to the DAG, their\nports must be connected (as shown in the earlier diagram) using\nstreams. Recall that a stream is represented by the \nDAG.StreamMeta\n\ninterface and is created via \nDAG.addStream()\n. The first argument is\nthe name of the stream, the second is the output port and the third\nthe input port. These statements form the second part of the\n\npopulateDAG\n function.\n\n\nThese two simple steps (a) adding operators to the DAG; and (b)\nconnecting their ports with streams are all it takes to build most\napplications. Of course, additional steps may be needed to configure\nsuitable properties to achieve the desired performance levels but those\nare often easier.",

Operators can have multiple input and output ports; they receive events on their input\nports and emit (potentially different) events on output ports. Thus, operators and ports\nare at the heart of all applications. The  Operator  interface extends the  Component \ninterface:  public interface Component  CONTEXT extends Context  {\n  public void setup(CONTEXT cntxt);\n  public void teardown();\n}  The  Operator  interface defines  Port ,  InputPort , and  OutputPort  as inner interfaces with InputPort , and  OutputPort  extending  Port .  public interface Operator extends Component Context.OperatorContext  {\n\n  public static interface Port extends Component Context.PortContext  {}\n\n  public static interface InputPort T extends Object  extends Port {\n    public Sink T  getSink();\n    public void setConnected(boolean bln);\n    public StreamCodec T  getStreamCodec();\n  }\n\n  public static interface OutputPort T extends Object  extends Port {\n    public void setSink(Sink Object  sink);\n    public Unifier T  getUnifier();\n  }\n\n  public void beginWindow(long l);\n  public void endWindow();\n}  Operators typically extend the  BaseOperator  class which simply\ndefines empty methods for  setup ,  teardown ,  beginWindow , and endWindow . Derived classes only need to define those functions for\nwhich they want to perform an action. For example the ConsoleOutputOperator  class, which is often used during testing and\ndebugging, does not override any of these methods.  Input operators typically receive data from some external source such\nas a database, message broker, or a file system. They might also\ncreate synthetic data internally. They then transform this data into\none or more events and write these events on one or more output ports;\nthey have no input ports (this might seem paradoxical at first, but is\nconsistent with our usage of input ports that dictates that input\nports only be used to receive data from other operators, not from an\nexternal source).  Input ports must implement the  InputOperator  interface.  public interface InputOperator extends Operator {\n  public void emitTuples();\n}  The  emitTuples  method will typically output one or more events on\nsome or all of the output ports defined in the operator. For example,\nthe simple application generated by the maven archetype command\ndiscussed earlier has an operator named  RandomNumberGenerator ,\nwhich is defined like this:  public class RandomNumberGenerator extends BaseOperator implements InputOperator {\n\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort Double  out = new DefaultOutputPort Double ();\n\n  public void emitTuples()  {\n    if (count++   100) {\n      out.emit(Math.random());\n    }\n  }\n}  Finally, the  DefaultInputPort  and  DefaultOutputPort  classes are\nvery useful as base classes that can be extended when defining ports\nin operators.  public abstract class DefaultInputPort T  implements InputPort T , Sink T  {\n  private int count;\n\n  public Sink T  getSink(){ return this; }\n\n  public void put(T tuple){\n    count++;\n    process(tuple);\n  }\n\n  public int getCount(boolean reset) {\n    try {\n      return count;\n    } finally {\n      if (reset) {\n        count = 0;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  public abstract void process(T tuple);\n}\n\npublic class DefaultOutputPort T  implements Operator.OutputPort T  {\n  private transient Sink Object  sink;\n\n  final public void setSink(Sink Object  s) {\n    this.sink = s == null?

The abstract  process  method needs to be\nimplemented by any concrete derived class; it will be invoked via the Sink.put  override.  The  DefaultOutputPort  class also supports a sink and forwards calls\nto  emit  to the sink. The  setSink  method is called by the  StrAM \nexecution engine to inject a suitable sink at deployment time.  Output operators are the opposite of input operators; they typically\nreceive data on one or more input ports from other operators and write\nthem to external sinks. They have no output ports.

To facilitate easy cross-referencing with the\ncode, we use the actual Java class names in the list below along with\nthe instance name in parentheses.  This diagram represents the Sales Dimension DAG. The\nports on these operators are connected via streams.  JsonSalesGenerator (InputGenerator)  This class (new operator) is an input operator that generates a single\nsales event defined by a class like this:  class SalesEvent {\n  /* dimension keys */\n  public long time;\n  public int productId;\n  public String customer;\n  public String channel;\n  public String region;\n  /* metrics */\n  public double sales;\n  public double discount;\n  public double tax;\n}  JsonToMapConverter (Converter)  This operator uses some special utility classes (ObjectReader and\nObjectMapper) to transform JSON event data to Java maps for easy\nmanipulation in Java code; it is fairly simple:  public class JsonToMapConverter extends BaseOperator {\n\n...\n\n  public final transient DefaultInputPort byte\\[\\]  input = new DefaultInputPort byte[] () {\n    public void process(byte\\[\\] message) {\n      Map String, Object  tuple = reader.readValue(message);\n      outputMap.emit(tuple);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort Map String, Object  outputMap\n     = new DefaultOutputPort Map String, Object ();\n\n}  EnrichmentOperator (Enrichment)  This operator performs category lookup based on incoming numeric\nproduct IDs and adds the corresponding category names to the output\nevents. The mapping is read from the text file  products.txt  that\nwe encountered earlier while building the application. It contains\ndata like this:  {\"productId\":96,\"product\":\"Printers\"}\n{\"productId\":97,\"product\":\"Routers\"}\n{\"productId\":98,\"product\":\"Smart Phones\"}  The core functionality of this operator is in the  process  function of\nthe input port where it looks up the product identifier in the\nenrichment mapping and adds the result to the event before emitting it\nto the output port. The mapping file can be modified at runtime to add\nor remove productId to category mapping pairs, so there is also some\ncode to check the modification timestamp and re-read the file if necessary.  public class EnrichmentOperator extends BaseOperator {\n  ...\n  public transient DefaultOutputPort Map String, Object \n    outputPort = new DefaultOutputPort Map String, Object ();\n\n  public transient DefaultInputPort Map String, Object \n    inputPort = new DefaultInputPort Map String, Object () {\n\n    public void process(Map String, Object  tuple) {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}  DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaMap (DimensionsComputation)  This operator performs dimension computations on incoming data. Sales\nnumbers by all combinations of region, product category, customer, and\nsales channel should be computed and emitted.  AppDataSingleDimensionStoreHDHT (Store)  This operator stores computed dimensional information on HDFS,\noptimized for fast retrieval so that it can respond to queries.  PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery (Query)  This is the dashboard connector for visualization queries.\nThis operator and the next are used respectively to send queries and\nretrieve results from the Data Torrent Gateway which can act like a\nmessage broker for limited amounts of data using a topic-based\npublish/subscribe model. The URL to connect to is typically something\nlike  ws:// gateway-host : port /pubsub  where gateway-host  and  port  should be replaced by appropriate values.  A publisher sends a JSON message that looks like this to the URL\nwhere the value of the  data  key is the desired message content:  {\"type\":\"publish\", \"topic\":\"foobar\", \"data\": ...}  Correspondingly, subscribers send messages like this\nto retrieve published message data:  {\"type\":\"subscribe\", \"topic\":\"foobar\"}  Topic names need not be pre-registered anywhere but obviously, the\nsame topic name (e.g.  foobar  in the example above) must be used by both\npublisher and subscriber; additionally, if there are no subscribers when\na message is published, it is simply discarded.  This query operator is an input operator used to send queries from\nthe dashboard to the store via the gateway:  public class PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery extends PubSubWebSocketInputOperator String \nimplements AppData.ConnectionInfoProvider {\n  ...\n  protected String convertMessage(String message) {\n    JSONObject jo = new JSONObject(message);\n    return jo.getString(\"data\");\n  }\n}  The important method here is  convertMessage  to convert the input\nstring to a JSON object, get the value of the  data  key from the object\nand return it. The base classes look like this:  public class PubSubWebSocketInputOperator T  extends WebSocketInputOperator T  {\n  ...\n}  This class simply converts a JSON event into Java maps via the convertMessage  method.  public class WebSocketInputOperator T  extends\nSimpleSinglePortInputOperator T  implements Runnable {\n  ...\n}  This code is intended to be run in an asynchronous thread to retrieve\nevents from an external source and emit them on the output port.  public abstract class SimpleSinglePortInputOperator T  extends BaseOperator\nimplements InputOperator, Operator.ActivationListener OperatorContext  {\n\n  final public transient BufferingOutputPort T  outputPort;\n\n  final public void activate(OperatorContext ctx) {\n  }\n\n  public void emitTuples() {\n    outputPort.flush(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n  }\n\n  public static class BufferingOutputPort T  extends DefaultOutputPort T  {\n    public void flush(int count) { ... }\n  }\n\n}  The class starts a separate thread which retrieves source events and\ninvokes the  emit  method of the output port; the output port buffers\nevents until the  flush  method is called at which point all buffered\nevents are emitted.  PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult (QueryResult)  This is the dashboard connector for results of visualization queries\nand is the result counterpart of the previous input query operator:  public class PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult extends PubSubWebSocketOutputOperator String \nimplements AppData.ConnectionInfoProvider {\n  ...\n}  This class merely overrides the generic  convertMapToMessage  method of the\nbase class to generate the required JSON publish message.  public class PubSubWebSocketOutputOperator T  extends WebSocketOutputOperator T  {\n  ...\n}  This class, similarly, doesn't do much   the  convertMapToMessage \nmethod converts input data into a suitable JSON object for publishing to the\nregistered topic.  public class WebSocketOutputOperator T  extends BaseOperator {\n  public final transient DefaultInputPort T  input = new DefaultInputPort T () {\n    public void process(T t) {\n      ...\n\n      connection.sendTextMessage(convertMapToMessage(t));\n    }\n  }\n}  The key element in this class is the input port (the rest of the code\ndeals with establishing a connection and reconnecting if\nnecessary). As usual, the key method in the input port is  process \nwhich converts the incoming event to a JSON message and sends it\nacross the connection.",

Once the operators are added to the DAG, their\nports must be connected (as shown in the earlier diagram) using\nstreams. Recall that a stream is represented by the  DAG.StreamMeta \ninterface and is created via  DAG.addStream() . The first argument is\nthe name of the stream, the second is the output port and the third\nthe input port. These statements form the second part of the populateDAG  function.  These two simple steps (a) adding operators to the DAG; and (b)\nconnecting their ports with streams are all it takes to build most\napplications. Of course, additional steps may be needed to configure\nsuitable properties to achieve the desired performance levels but those\nare often easier.",

There are multiple git clients available for Windows (\nhttp://git-scm.com/download/win\n for example), so download and install a client of your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njava JDK\n (not JRE). Includes the Java Runtime Environment as well as the Java compiler and a variety of tools (version 1.7.0_79 or later). Can be downloaded from the Oracle website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaven\n -- Apache Maven is a build system for Java projects (version 3.0.5 or later). It can be downloaded from \nhttps://maven.apache.org/download.cgi\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n -- Oracle VirtualBox is a virtual machine manager (version 4.3 or later) and can be downloaded from \nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n. It is needed to run the DataTorrent Sandbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataTorrent Sandbox\n -- The sandbox can be downloaded from \nhttps://www.datatorrent.com/download\n. It is useful for testing simple applications since it contains Apache Hadoop and DataTorrent RTS pre-installed with a time-limited Enterprise License. If you already installed the RTS Enterprise Edition (evaluation or production license) on a cluster, you can use that setup for deployment and testing instead of the sandbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) If you prefer to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as \nNetBeans\n, \nEclipse\n or \nIntelliJ\n, install that as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing these tools, make sure that the directories containing the executable files are in your PATH environment; for example, for the JDK executables like \njava\n and \njavac\n, the directory might be something like \nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0\\_80\\bin\n; for \ngit\n it might be \nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\n; and for maven it might be \nC:\\Users\\user\\Software\\apache-maven-3.3.3\\bin\n. Open a console window and enter the command:\n\n\necho %PATH%\n\n\n\nto see the value of the \nPATH\n variable and verify that the above directories are present. If not, you can change its value clicking on the button at \nControl Panel\n \n \nAdvanced System Settings\n \n \nAdvanced tab\n \n \nEnvironment Variables\n.\n\n\nNow run the following commands and ensure that the output is something similar to that shown in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\njavac -version\n\n\njavac 1.7.0_80\n\n\n\n\n\n\njava -version\n\n\njava version \n1.7.0_80\n\n\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_80-b15)\n\n\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.80-b11, mixed mode)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit --version\n\n\ngit version 2.6.1.windows.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmvn --version\n\n\nApache Maven 3.3.3 (7994120775791599e205a5524ec3e0dfe41d4a06; 2015-04-22T06:57:37-05:00)\n\n\nMaven home: C:\\Users\\user\\Software\\apache-maven-3.3.3\\bin\\..\n\n\nJava version: 1.7.0_80, vendor: Oracle Corporation\n\n\nJava home: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_80\\jre\n\n\nDefault locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252\n\n\nOS name: \nwindows 8\n, version: \n6.2\n, arch: \namd64\n, family: \nwindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Sandbox\n\n\nThe sandbox includes, as noted above, a complete, stand-alone, instance of the\nDatatorrent RTS Enterprise Edition configured as a single-node Hadoop cluster. Please\nsee \nDataTorrent RTS Sandbox\n for details on setting up the sandbox.\n\n\nYou can choose to develop either directly on the sandbox or on your development machine. The advantage of the former is that most of the tools (e.g. \njdk\n, \ngit\n, \nmaven\n) are pre-installed and also the package files created by your project are directly available to the DataTorrent tools such as  \ndtManage\n and \nApex CLI\n. The disadvantage is that the sandbox is a memory-limited environment so running a memory-hungry tool like a Java IDE on it may starve other applications of memory.\n\n\nCreating a new Project\n\n\nYou can now use the maven archetype to create a basic Apache Apex project as follows: Put these lines in a Windows command file called, for example, \nnewapp.cmd\n and run it (the\nvalue for \narchetypeVersion\n can be a more recent version if available):\n\n\n@echo off\n@rem Script for creating a new application\nsetlocal\nmvn -B archetype:generate ^\n  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.apex ^\n  -DarchetypeArtifactId=apex-app-archetype ^\n  -DarchetypeVersion=3.6.0-SNAPSHOT ^\n  -DgroupId=com.example ^\n  -Dpackage=com.example.myapexapp ^\n  -DartifactId=myapexapp ^\n  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT\nendlocal\n\n\n\nThe caret (^) at the end of some lines indicates that a continuation line follows.\n\n\nThis command will eventually become outdated, check the \napex-app-archetype README\n\nfor the latest version, which includes the most recent archetypeVersion.\n\n\nYou can also, if you prefer, use an IDE to generate the project as described in\n\nCreating a New Apache Apex Project with your IDE\n.\n\n\nWhen the run completes successfully, you should see a new directory named \nmyapexapp\n containing a maven project for building a basic Apache Apex application. It includes 3 source files:\nApplication.java\n,  \nRandomNumberGenerator.java\n and \nApplicationTest.java\n. You can now build the application by stepping into the new directory and running the appropriate maven command:\n\n\ncd myapexapp\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\n\n\n\nThe build should create the application package file \nmyapexapp\\target\\myapexapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apa\n. This file can then be uploaded to the DataTorrent GUI tool (\ndtManage\n) on your cluster if you have DataTorrent RTS installed there, or on the sandbox and launched  from there. It generates a stream of random numbers and prints them out, each prefixed by the string  \nhello world:\n.\n\n\nIf you built this package on the host, you can transfer it to the sandbox using either a shared folder or the \npscp\n tool bundled with \nPuTTY\n mentioned earlier.\n\n\nYou can also run this application from the generated unit test file as described in the\nnext section.\n\n\nRunning Unit Tests\n\n\nTo run unit tests on Linux or OSX, simply run the usual maven command, for example: \nmvn test\n\nto run all tests or \nmvn -Dcom.example.myapexapp.ApplicationTest#testApplication test\n to run\na selected test. For the default application generated from the archetype, it should\nprint output like this:\n\n\n -------------------------------------------------------\n  TESTS\n -------------------------------------------------------\n\n Running com.example.mydtapp.ApplicationTest\n hello world: 0.8015370953286478\n hello world: 0.9785359225545481\n hello world: 0.6322611586644047\n hello world: 0.8460953663451775\n hello world: 0.5719372906929072\n ...\n\n Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.863\n sec\n\n Results :\n\n Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\n\n\n\nOn Windows, an additional file, \nwinutils.exe\n, is required; download it from\n\nhttps://github.com/srccodes/hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin/archive/master.zip\n\nand unpack the archive to, say, \nC:\\hadoop\n; this file should be present under\n\nhadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master\\bin\n within it.\n\n\nSet the \nHADOOP_HOME\n environment variable system-wide to\n\nc:\\hadoop\\hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master\n as described at:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx?mfr=true\n. You should now be able to run unit tests normally.\n\n\nIf you prefer not to set the variable globally, you can set it on the command line or within\nyour IDE. For example, on the command line, specify the maven\nproperty \nhadoop.home.dir\n:\n\n\nmvn -Dhadoop.home.dir=c:\\hadoop\\hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master test\n\n\n\nor set the environment variable separately:\n\n\nset HADOOP_HOME=c:\\hadoop\\hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master\nmvn test\n\n\n\nWithin your IDE, set the environment variable and then run the desired\nunit test in the usual way. For example, with NetBeans you can add:\n\n\nEnv.HADOOP_HOME=c:/hadoop/hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master\n\n\n\nat \nProperties \n Actions \n Run project \n Set Properties\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, in Eclipse (Mars) add it to the\nproject properties at \nProperties\n \n \nRun/Debug Settings\n \n \nApplicationTest\n\n\n \nEnvironment\n tab.\n\n\nBuilding the Sources\n\n\nThe Apache Apex source code is useful to have locally for a variety of reasons:\n- It has more substantial demo applications which can serve as models for new\n  applications in the same or similar domain.\n- When extending a class, it is helpful to refer to the base class implementation\n  of overrideable methods.\n- The maven build file \npom.xml\n can be a useful model when you need to add or delete\n  plugins, dependencies, profiles, etc.\n- Browsing the code is a good way to gain a deeper understanding of the platform.\n\n\nYou can download and build the source repositories by running the script \nbuild-apex.cmd\n\nlocated in the same place in the examples repository described above. Alternatively, if\nyou do not want to use the script, you can follow these simple manual steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the source code repositories:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-apex-core\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-apex-malhar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to the appropriate release branch and build each repository:\n\n\npushd incubator-apex-core\nmvn clean install -DskipTests\npopd\npushd incubator-apex-malhar\nmvn clean install -DskipTests\npopd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ninstall\n argument to the \nmvn\n command installs resources from each project to your\nlocal maven repository (typically \n.m2/repository\n under your home directory), and\n\nnot\n to the system directories, so \nAdministrator\n privileges are not required.\nThe  \n-DskipTests\n argument skips running unit tests since they take a long time. If this is a first-time installation, it might take several minutes to complete because maven will download a number of associated plugins.\n\n\nAfter the build completes, you should see application package files in the \ntarget\n\ndirectories under each module; for example, the \nPi Demo\n package file\n\npi-demo-3.2.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT.apa\n should be under\n\nincubator-apex-malhar\\demos\\pi\\target\n.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMost of the instructions for Linux (and other Unix-like systems) are similar to those for Windows described above, so we will just note the differences.\n\n\nThe pre-requisites (such as \ngit\n, \nmaven\n, etc.) are the same as for Windows described above; please run the commands in the table and ensure that appropriate versions are present in your PATH environment variable (the command to display that variable is: \necho $PATH\n).\n\n\nThe maven archetype command is the same except that continuation lines use a backslash (\n\\\n) instead of caret (\n^\n); the script for it is available in the same location and is named \nnewapp\n (without the \n.cmd\n extension). The script to checkout and build the Apache Apex repositories is named \nbuild-apex\n.",

A few businesses have yielded to very expensive\nsolutions like building an in-house, real-time analytics infrastructure\nsupported by an internal development team, or buying expensive\nproprietary software. A large number of businesses are dealing with the\nrequirement just by trying to make Hadoop do their batch jobs in smaller\niterations. Over the last few years, Hadoop has become ubiquitous in the\nbig data processing space, replacing expensive proprietary hardware and\nsoftware solutions for massive data processing with very cost-effective,\nfault-tolerant, open-sourced, and commodity-hardware-based solutions.\nWhile Hadoop has been a game changer for companies, it is primarily a\nbatch-oriented system, and does not yet have a viable option for\nreal-time data processing. \u00a0Most companies with real-time data\nprocessing end up having to build customized solutions in addition to\ntheir Hadoop infrastructure.\n\n\nThe DataTorrent platform is designed to process massive amounts of\nreal-time events natively in Hadoop. This can be event ingestion,\nprocessing, and aggregation for real-time data analytics, or can be\nreal-time business logic decisioning such as cell tower load balancing,\nreal-time ads bidding, or fraud detection. \u00a0The platform has the ability\nto repair itself in real-time (without data loss) if hardware fails, and\nadapt to changes in load by adding and removing computing resources\nautomatically.\n\n\nDataTorrent is a native Hadoop application. It runs as a YARN\n(Hadoop 2.x) application and leverages Hadoop as a distributed operating\nsystem. All the basic distributed operating system capabilities of\nHadoop like resource allocation (Resource Manager, distributed file system (HDFS),\nmulti-tenancy, security, fault-tolerance, scalability,\u00a0etc.\nare supported natively in all streaming applications. \u00a0Just as Hadoop\nfor map-reduce handles all the details of the application allowing you\nto only focus on writing the application (the mapper and reducer\nfunctions), the platform handles all the details of streaming execution,\nallowing you to only focus on your business logic. Using the platform\nremoves the need to maintain separate clusters for real-time\napplications.\n\n\nIn the platform, building a streaming application can be extremely\neasy and intuitive. \u00a0The application is represented as a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) of computation units called \nOperators\n interconnected\nby the data-flow edges called  \nStreams\n.\u00a0The operators process input\nstreams and produce output streams. A library of common operators is\nprovided to enable quick application development. \u00a0In case the desired\nprocessing is not available in the Operator Library, one can easily\nwrite a custom operator. We refer those interested in creating their own\noperators to the \nOperator Development Guide\n.\n\n\nRunning A Test Application\n\n\nThis chapter will help you with a quick start on running an\napplication. If you are starting with the platform for the first time,\nit would be informative to open an existing application and see it run.\nDo the following steps to run the PI demo, which computes the value of\nPI \u00a0in a simple\nmanner:\n\n\n\n\nOpen up platform files in your IDE (for example NetBeans, or Eclipse)\n\n\nOpen Demos project\n\n\nOpen Test Packages and run ApplicationTest.java\u00a0in pi\u00a0package\n\n\nSee the results in your system console\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you just ran your first real-time streaming demo\n:) This demo is very simple and has four operators. The first operator\nemits random integers between 0 to 30, 000. The second operator receives\nthese coefficients and emits a hashmap with x and y values each time it\nreceives two values. The third operator takes these values and computes\nx**2+y**2. The last operator counts how many computed values from\nthe previous operator were less than or equal to 30, 000**2. Assuming\nthis count is N, then PI is computed as N/number of values received.\nHere is the code snippet for the PI application. This code populates the\nDAG. Do not worry about what each line does, we will cover these\nconcepts later in this document.\n\n\n// Generates random numbers\nRandomEventGenerator rand = dag.addOperator(\nrand\n, new RandomEventGenerator());\nrand.setMinvalue(0);\nrand.setMaxvalue(30000);\n\n// Generates a round robin HashMap of \nx\n and \ny\n\nRoundRobinHashMap\nString,Object\n rrhm = dag.addOperator(\nrrhm\n, new RoundRobinHashMap\nString, Object\n());\nrrhm.setKeys(new String[] { \nx\n, \ny\n });\n\n// Calculates pi from x and y\nJavaScriptOperator calc = dag.addOperator(\npicalc\n, new Script());\ncalc.setPassThru(false);\ncalc.put(\ni\n,0);\ncalc.put(\ncount\n,0);\ncalc.addSetupScript(\nfunction pi() { if (x*x+y*y \n= \n+maxValue*maxValue+\n) { i++; } count++; return i / count * 4; }\n);\ncalc.setInvoke(\npi\n);\ndag.addStream(\nrand_rrhm\n, rand.integer_data, rrhm.data);\ndag.addStream(\nrrhm_calc\n, rrhm.map, calc.inBindings);\n\n// puts results on system console\nConsoleOutputOperator console = dag.addOperator(\nconsole\n, new ConsoleOutputOperator());\ndag.addStream(\nrand_console\n,calc.result, console.input);\n\n\n\n\nYou can review the other demos and see what they do. The examples\ngiven in the Demos project cover various features of the platform and we\nstrongly encourage you to read these to familiarize yourself with the\nplatform. In the remaining part of this document we will go through\ndetails needed for you to develop and run streaming applications in\nMalhar.\n\n\nTest Application: Yahoo! Finance Quotes\n\n\nThe PI\u00a0application was to\nget you started. It is a basic application and does not fully illustrate\nthe features of the platform. For the purpose of describing concepts, we\nwill consider the test application shown in Figure 1. The application\ndownloads tick data from  \nYahoo! Finance\n \u00a0and computes the\nfollowing for four tickers, namely \nIBM\n,\n\nGOOG\n, \nYHOO\n.\n\n\n\n\nQuote: Consisting of last trade price, last trade time, and\n    total volume for the day\n\n\nPer-minute chart data: Highest trade price, lowest trade\n    price, and volume during that minute\n\n\nSimple Moving Average: trade price over 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\nTotal volume must ensure that all trade volume for that day is\nadded, i.e. data loss would result in wrong results. Charting data needs\nall the trades in the same minute to go to the same slot, and then on it\nstarts afresh, so again data loss would result in wrong results. The\naggregation for charting data is done over 1 minute. Simple moving\naverage computes the average price over a 5 minute sliding window; it\ntoo would produce wrong results if there is data loss. Figure 1 shows\nthe application with no partitioning.\n\n\n\n\nThe operator StockTickerInput:\u00a0StockTickerInput\n\u00a0\nis\nthe input operator that reads live data from Yahoo! Finance once per\ninterval (user configurable in milliseconds), and emits the price, the\nincremental volume, and the last trade time of each stock symbol, thus\nemulating real ticks from the exchange. \u00a0We utilize the Yahoo! Finance\nCSV web service interface. \u00a0For example:\n\n\n$ GET 'http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=IBM,GOOG,AAPL,YHOO\nf=sl1vt1'\n\nIBM\n,203.966,1513041,\n1:43pm\n\n\nGOOG\n,762.68,1879741,\n1:43pm\n\n\nAAPL\n,444.3385,11738366,\n1:43pm\n\n\nYHOO\n,19.3681,14707163,\n1:43pm\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong all the operators in Figure 1, StockTickerInput is the only\noperator that requires extra code because it contains a custom mechanism\nto get the input data. \u00a0Other operators are used unchanged from the\nMalhar library.\n\n\nHere is the class implementation for StockTickInput:\n\n\npackage com.datatorrent.demos.yahoofinance;\n\nimport au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVReader;\nimport com.datatorrent.annotation.OutputPortFieldAnnotation;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.Context.OperatorContext;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.DefaultOutputPort;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.InputOperator;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.util.KeyValPair;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.util.*;\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient;\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpStatus;\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.cookie.CookiePolicy;\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod;\nimport org.apache.commons.httpclient.params.DefaultHttpParams;\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\n/**\n * This operator sends price, volume and time into separate ports and calculates incremental volume.\n */\npublic class StockTickInput implements InputOperator\n{\n  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(StockTickInput.class);\n  /**\n   * Timeout interval for reading from server. 0 or negative indicates no timeout.\n   */\n  public int readIntervalMillis = 500;\n  /**\n   * The URL of the web service resource for the POST request.\n   */\n  private String url;\n  public String[] symbols;\n  private transient HttpClient client;\n  private transient GetMethod method;\n  private HashMap\nString, Long\n lastVolume = new HashMap\nString, Long\n();\n  private boolean outputEvenIfZeroVolume = false;\n  /**\n   * The output port to emit price.\n   */\n  @OutputPortFieldAnnotation(optional = true)\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, Double\n price = new DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, Double\n();\n  /**\n   * The output port to emit incremental volume.\n   */\n  @OutputPortFieldAnnotation(optional = true)\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, Long\n volume = new DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, Long\n();\n  /**\n   * The output port to emit last traded time.\n   */\n  @OutputPortFieldAnnotation(optional = true)\n  public final transient DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, String\n time = new DefaultOutputPort\nKeyValPair\nString, String\n();\n\n  /**\n   * Prepare URL from symbols and parameters.

Finance.\n\n\nMethod\u00a0emitTuples() contains\nthe code that reads from Yahoo! Finance, and emits the data to the\noutput ports of the operator. \u00a0emitTuples()\u00a0will be called one or more times\nwithin one application window as long as time is allowed within the\nwindow.\n\n\nNote that we want to emulate the tick input stream by having\nincremental volume data with Yahoo! Finance data. \u00a0We therefore subtract\nthe previous volume from the current volume to emulate incremental\nvolume for each tick.\n\n\nThe operator\nDailyVolume:\u00a0This operator\nreads from the input port, which contains the incremental volume tuples\nfrom StockTickInput, and\naggregates the data to provide the cumulative volume. \u00a0It uses the\nlibrary class  SumKeyVal\nK,V\n\u00a0provided in math\u00a0package. \u00a0In this case,\nSumKeyVal\nString,Long\n, where K is the stock symbol, V is the\naggregated volume, with cumulative\nset to true. (Otherwise if cumulative was set to false, SumKeyVal would\nprovide the sum for the application window.) \u00a0Malhar provides a number\nof built-in operators for simple operations like this so that\napplication developers do not have to write them. \u00a0More examples to\nfollow. This operator assumes that the application restarts before the\nmarket opens every day.\n\n\nThe operator Quote:\nThis operator has three input ports, which are price (from\nStockTickInput), daily_vol (from\nDaily Volume), and time (from\n StockTickInput). \u00a0This operator\njust consolidates the three data items and and emits the consolidated\ndata. \u00a0It utilizes the class ConsolidatorKeyVal\nK\n\u00a0from the\nstream\u00a0package.\n\n\nThe operator HighLow:\u00a0This operator reads from the input port,\nwhich contains the price tuples from StockTickInput, and provides the high and the\nlow price within the application window. \u00a0It utilizes the library class\n RangeKeyVal\nK,V\n\u00a0provided\nin the math\u00a0package. In this case,\nRangeKeyVal\nString,Double\n.\n\n\nThe operator MinuteVolume:\nThis operator reads from the input port, which contains the\nvolume tuples from StockTickInput,\nand aggregates the data to provide the sum of the volume within one\nminute. \u00a0Like the operator  DailyVolume, this operator also uses\nSumKeyVal\nString,Long\n, but\nwith cumulative set to false. \u00a0The\nApplication Window is set to one minute. We will explain how to set this\nlater.\n\n\nThe operator Chart:\nThis operator is very similar to the operator Quote, except that it takes inputs from\nHigh Low\u00a0and  Minute Vol\u00a0and outputs the consolidated tuples\nto the output port.\n\n\nThe operator PriceSMA:\nSMA stands for - Simple Moving Average. It reads from the\ninput port, which contains the price tuples from StockTickInput, and\nprovides the moving average price of the stock. \u00a0It utilizes\nSimpleMovingAverage\nString,Double\n, which is provided in the\n multiwindow\u00a0package.\nSimpleMovingAverage keeps track of the data of the previous N\napplication windows in a sliding manner. \u00a0For each end window event, it\nprovides the average of the data in those application windows.\n\n\nThe operator Console:\nThis operator just outputs the input tuples to the console\n(or stdout). \u00a0In this example, there are four console\u00a0operators, which connect to the output\nof  Quote, Chart, PriceSMA and VolumeSMA. \u00a0In\npractice, they should be replaced by operators that use the data to\nproduce visualization artifacts like charts.\n\n\nConnecting the operators together and constructing the\nDAG:\u00a0Now that we know the\noperators used, we will create the DAG, set the streaming window size,\ninstantiate the operators, and connect the operators together by adding\nstreams that connect the output ports with the input ports among those\noperators. \u00a0This code is in the file  YahooFinanceApplication.java. Refer to Figure 1\nagain for the graphical representation of the DAG. \u00a0The last method in\nthe code, namely getApplication(),\ndoes all that. \u00a0The rest of the methods are just for setting up the\noperators.\n\n\npackage com.datatorrent.demos.yahoofinance;\n\nimport com.datatorrent.api.ApplicationFactory;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.Context.OperatorContext;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.DAG;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.Operator.InputPort;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.io.ConsoleOutputOperator;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.math.RangeKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.math.SumKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.multiwindow.SimpleMovingAverage;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.stream.ConsolidatorKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.util.HighLow;\nimport org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;\n\n/**\n * Yahoo!

We assume that \u00a0you are familiar with details\nof your Hadoop infrastructure. For installation\ndetails please refer to the \nInstallation Guide\n.\n\n\nRunning a Test Application\n\n\nWe will now describe how to run the yahoo\nfinance application\u00a0described above in different modes\n(local mode, single node on Hadoop, and multi-nodes on Hadoop).\n\n\nThe platform runs streaming applications under the control of a\nlight-weight Streaming Application Manager (STRAM). Each application has\nits own instance of STRAM. STRAM launches the application and\ncontinually provides run time monitoring, analysis, and takes action\nsuch as load scaling or outage recovery as needed. \u00a0We will discuss\nSTRAM in more detail in the next chapter.\n\n\nThe instructions below assume that the platform was installed in a\ndirectory \nINSTALL_DIR\n and the command line interface (CLI) will\nbe used to launch the demo application. An application can be run in\n\nlocal mode\n\u00a0\n(in IDE or from command line) or on a  \nHadoop cluster\n \n.\n\n\nTo start the Apex CLI run\n\n\nINSTALL_DIR\n/bin/apex\n\n\n\nThe command line prompt appears.  To start the application in local mode (the actual version number in the file name may differ)\n\n\napex\n launch -local \nINSTALL_DIR\n/yahoo-finance-demo-3.4.0.apa\n\n\n\nTo terminate the application in local mode, enter Ctrl-C\n\n\nTu run the application on the Hadoop cluster (the actual version\nnumber in the file name may differ)\n\n\napex\n launch \nINSTALL_DIR\n/yahoo-finance-demo-3.4.0.apa\n\n\n\nTo stop the application running in Hadoop, terminate it in the Apex CLI:\n\n\napex\n kill-app\n\n\n\nExecuting the application in either mode includes the following\nsteps. At a top level, STRAM (Streaming Application Manager) validates\nthe application (DAG), translates the logical plan to the physical plan\nand then launches the execution engine. The mode determines the\nresources needed and how how they are used.\n\n\nLocal Mode\n\n\nIn local mode, the application is run as a single-process\u00a0with multiple threads. Although a\nfew Hadoop classes are needed, there is no dependency on a Hadoop\ncluster or Hadoop services. The local file system is used in place of\nHDFS. This mode allows a quick run of an application in a single process\nsandbox, and hence is the most suitable to debug and analyze the\napplication logic. This mode is recommended for developing the\napplication and can be used for running applications within the IDE for\nfunctional testing purposes. Due to limited resources and lack \u00a0of\nscalability an application running in this single process mode is more\nlikely to encounter throughput bottlenecks. A distributed cluster is\nrecommended for benchmarking and production testing.\n\n\nHadoop Cluster\n\n\nIn this section we discuss various Hadoop cluster setups.\n\n\nSingle Node Cluster\n\n\nIn a single node Hadoop cluster all services are deployed on a\nsingle server (a developer can use his/her development machine as a\nsingle node cluster). The platform does not distinguish between a single\nor multi-node setup and behaves exactly the same in both cases.\n\n\nIn this mode, the resource manager, name node, data node, and node\nmanager occupy one process each. This is an example of running a\nstreaming application as a multi-process\u00a0application on the same server.\nWith prevalence of fast, multi-core systems, this mode is effective for\ndebugging, fine tuning, and generic analysis before submitting the job\nto a larger Hadoop cluster. In this mode, execution uses the Hadoop\nservices and hence is likely to identify issues that are related to the\nHadoop environment (such issues will not be uncovered in local mode).\nThe throughput will obviously not be as high as on a multi-node Hadoop\ncluster. Additionally, since each container (i.e. Java process) requires\na significant amount of memory, you will be able to run a much smaller\nnumber of containers than on a multi-node cluster.\n\n\nMulti-Node Cluster\n\n\nIn a multi-node Hadoop cluster all the services of Hadoop are\ntypically distributed across multiple nodes in a production or\nproduction-level test environment. Upon launch the application is\nsubmitted to the Hadoop cluster and executes as a  multi-processapplication on\u00a0multiple nodes.\n\n\nBefore you start deploying, testing and troubleshooting your\napplication on a cluster, you should ensure that Hadoop (version 2.2.0\nor later)\u00a0is properly installed and\nyou have basic skills for working with it.\n\n\n\n\nApache Apex Platform Overview\n\n\nStreaming Computational Model\n\n\nIn this chapter, we describe the the basics of the real-time streaming platform and its computational model.\n\n\nThe platform is designed to enable completely asynchronous real time computations\u00a0done in as unblocked a way as possible with\nminimal overhead .\n\n\nApplications running in the platform are represented by a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) made up of \u00a0operators and streams. All computations\nare done in memory on arrival of\nthe input data, with an option to save the output to disk (HDFS) in a\nnon-blocking way. The data that flows between operators consists of\natomic data elements. Each data element along with its type definition\n(henceforth called  schema) is\ncalled a tuple.\u00a0An application is a\ndesign of the flow of these tuples to and from\nthe appropriate compute units to enable the computation of the final\ndesired results.\u00a0A message queue (henceforth called\n\u00a0buffer server) manages tuples streaming\nbetween compute units in different processes.This server keeps track of\nall consumers, publishers, partitions, and enables replay. More\ninformation is given in later section.\n\n\nThe streaming application is monitored by a decision making entity\ncalled STRAM (streaming application\nmanager).\u00a0STRAM is designed to be a light weight\ncontroller that has minimal but sufficient interaction with the\napplication. This is done via periodic heartbeats. The\nSTRAM does the initial launch and periodically analyzes the system\nmetrics to decide if any run time action needs to be taken.\n\n\nA fundamental building block for the streaming platform\nis the concept of breaking up a stream into equal finite time slices\ncalled streaming windows. Each window contains the ordered\nset of tuples in that time slice. A typical duration of a window is 500\nms, but can be configured per application (the Yahoo! Finance\napplication configures this value in the  properties.xml\u00a0file to be 1000ms = 1s). Each\nwindow is preceded by a begin_window\u00a0event and is terminated by an\nend_window\u00a0event, and is assigned\na unique window ID. Even though the platform performs computations at\nthe tuple level, bookkeeping is done at the window boundary, making the\ncomputations within a window an atomic event in the platform. \u00a0We can\nthink of each window as an  atomic\nmicro-batch\u00a0of tuples, to be processed together as one\natomic operation (See Figure 2). \u00a0\n\n\nThis atomic batching allows the platform to avoid the very steep\nper tuple bookkeeping cost and instead has a manageable per batch\nbookkeeping cost. This translates to higher throughput, low recovery\ntime, and higher scalability. Later in this document we illustrate how\nthe atomic micro-batch concept allows more efficient optimization\nalgorithms.\n\n\nThe platform also has in-built support for\napplication windows.\u00a0 An application window is part of the\napplication specification, and can be a small or large multiple of the\nstreaming window. \u00a0An example from our Yahoo! Finance test application\nis the moving average, calculated over a sliding application window of 5\nminutes which equates to 300 (= 5 * 60) streaming windows.\n\n\nNote that these two window concepts are distinct. \u00a0A streaming\nwindow is an abstraction of many tuples into a higher atomic event for\neasier management. \u00a0An application window is a group of consecutive\nstreaming windows used for data aggregation (e.g. sum, average, maximum,\nminimum) on a per operator level.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the platform,\u00a0a set of\npredefined, benchmarked standard library operator templates is provided\nfor ease of use and rapid development of application.\u00a0These\noperators are open sourced to Apache Software Foundation under the\nproject name \u201cMalhar\u201d as part of our efforts to foster community\ninnovation. These operators can be used in a DAG as is, while others\nhave  \nproperties\n\n\n\u00a0\nthat can be set to specify the\ndesired computation. Those interested in details, should refer to\n\nApex Malhar Operator Library\n\n.\n\n\nThe platform is a Hadoop YARN native\napplication. It runs in a Hadoop cluster just like any\nother YARN application (MapReduce etc.) and is designed to seamlessly\nintegrate with rest of Hadoop technology stack. It leverages Hadoop as\nmuch as possible and relies on it as its distributed operating system.\nHadoop dependencies include resource management, compute/memory/network\nallocation, HDFS, security, fault tolerance, monitoring, metrics,\nmulti-tenancy, logging etc. Hadoop classes/concepts are reused as much\nas possible.  The aim is to enable enterprises\nto leverage their existing Hadoop infrastructure for real time streaming\napplications. The platform is designed to scale with big\ndata applications and scale with Hadoop.\n\n\nA streaming application is an asynchronous execution of\ncomputations across distributed nodes. All computations are done in\nparallel on a distributed cluster. The computation model is designed to\ndo as many parallel computations as possible in a non-blocking fashion.\nThe task of monitoring of the entire application is done on (streaming)\nwindow boundaries with a streaming window as an atomic entity. A window\ncompletion is a quantum of work done. There is no assumption that an\noperator can be interrupted at precisely a particular tuple or window.\n\n\nAn operator itself also\ncannot assume or predict the exact time a tuple that it emitted would\nget consumed by downstream operators. The operator processes the tuples\nit gets and simply emits new tuples based on its business logic. The\nonly guarantee it has is that the upstream operators are processing\neither the current or some later window, and the downstream operator is\nprocessing either the current or some earlier window. The completion of\na window (i.e. propagation of the  end_window\u00a0event through an operator) in any\noperator guarantees that all upstream operators have finished processing\nthis window. Thus, the end_window\u00a0event is blocking on an operator\nwith multiple outputs, and is a synchronization point in the DAG. The\n begin_window\u00a0event does not have\nany such restriction, a single begin_window\u00a0event from any upstream operator\ntriggers the operator to start processing tuples.\n\n\nStreaming Application Manager (STRAM)\n\n\nStreaming Application Manager (STRAM) is the Hadoop YARN native\napplication master. STRAM is the first process that is activated upon\napplication launch and orchestrates the streaming application on the\nplatform. STRAM is a lightweight controller process. The\nresponsibilities of STRAM include\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning the Application\n\n\n\n\nRead the\u00a0logical plan\u00a0of the application (DAG) submitted by the client\n\n\nValidate the logical plan\n\n\nTranslate the logical plan into a physical plan, where certain operators may  be partitioned (i.e. replicated) to multiple operators for  handling load.\n\n\nRequest resources (Hadoop containers) from Resource Manager,\n    per physical plan\n\n\nBased on acquired resources and application attributes, create\n    an execution plan\u00a0by partitioning the DAG into fragments,\n    each assigned to different containers.\n\n\nExecutes the application by deploying each fragment to\n    its container. Containers then start stream processing and run\n    autonomously, processing one streaming window after another. Each\n    container is represented as an instance of the  StreamingContainer\u00a0class, which updates\n    STRAM via the heartbeat protocol and processes directions received\n    from STRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinually monitoring the application via heartbeats from each StreamingContainer\n\n\n\n\nCollecting Application System Statistics and Logs\n\n\nLogging all application-wide decisions taken\n\n\nProviding system data on the state of the application via a  Web Service.\n\n\n\n\nSupporting \nFault Tolerance\n\n\na.  Detecting a node outage\nb.  Requesting a replacement resource from the Resource Manager\n    and scheduling state restoration for the streaming operators\nc.  Saving state to Zookeeper\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting \nDynamic\n    Partitioning\n:\n\u00a0Periodically\n    evaluating the SLA and modifying the physical plan if required\n    (logical plan does not change).\n\n\n\n\nEnabling \nSecurity\n:\n\u00a0Distributing\n    security tokens for distributed components of the execution engine\n    and securing web service requests.\n\n\nEnabling \nDynamic  modification\n\u00a0\nof\n    DAG: In the future, we intend to allow for user initiated\n    modification of the logical plan to allow for changes to the\n    processing logic and functionality.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the Yahoo! Finance Quote application scheduled on a\ncluster of 5 Hadoop containers (processes) is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\nAn example for the translation from a logical plan to a physical\nplan and an execution plan for a subset of the application is shown in\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\nHadoop Components\n\n\nIn this section we cover some aspects of Hadoop that your\nstreaming application interacts with. This section is not meant to\neducate the reader on Hadoop, but just get the reader acquainted with\nthe terms. We strongly advise readers to learn Hadoop from other\nsources.\n\n\nA streaming application runs as a native Hadoop 2.2 application.\nHadoop 2.2 does not differentiate between a map-reduce job and other\napplications, and hence as far as Hadoop is concerned, the streaming\napplication is just another job. This means that your application\nleverages all the bells and whistles Hadoop provides and is fully\nsupported within Hadoop technology stack. The platform is responsible\nfor properly integrating itself with the relevant components of Hadoop\nthat exist today and those that may emerge in the future\n\n\nAll investments that leverage multi-tenancy (for example quotas\nand queues), security (for example kerberos), data flow integration (for\nexample copying data in-out of HDFS), monitoring, metrics collections,\netc. will require no changes when streaming applications run on\nHadoop.\n\n\nYARN\n\n\nYARN\n is\nthe core library of Hadoop 2.2 that is tasked with resource management\nand works as a distributed application framework. In this section we\nwill walk through YARN's components. In Hadoop 2.2, the old jobTracker\nhas been replaced by a combination of ResourceManager (RM) and\nApplicationMaster (AM).\n\n\nResource Manager (RM)\n\n\nResourceManager\n(RM)\nmanages all the distributed resources. It allocates and arbitrates all\nthe slots and the resources (cpu, memory, network) of these slots. It\nworks with per-node NodeManagers (NMs) and per-application\nApplicationMasters (AMs). Currently memory usage is monitored by RM; in\nupcoming releases it will have CPU as well as network management. RM is\nshared by map-reduce and streaming applications. Running streaming\napplications requires no changes in the RM.\n\n\nApplication Master (AM)\n\n\nThe AM is the watchdog or monitoring process for your application\nand has the responsibility of negotiating resources with RM and\ninteracting with NodeManagers to get the allocated containers started.\nThe AM is the starting point of your application and is considered user\ncode (not system Hadoop code). The AM itself runs in one container. All\nresource management within the application are managed by the AM. This\nis a critical feature for Hadoop 2.2 where tasks done by jobTracker in\nHadoop 1.0 have been distributed allowing Hadoop 2.2 to scale much\nbeyond Hadoop 1.0. STRAM is a native YARN ApplicationManager.\n\n\nNode Managers (NM)\n\n\nThere is one \nNodeManager\n(NM)\nper node in the cluster. All the containers (i.e. processes) on that\nnode are monitored by the NM. It takes instructions from RM and manages\nresources of that node as per RM instructions. NMs interactions are same\nfor map-reduce and for streaming applications. Running streaming\napplications requires no changes in the NM.\n\n\nRPC Protocol\n\n\nCommunication among RM, AM, and NM is done via the Hadoop RPC\nprotocol. Streaming applications use the same protocol to send their\ndata. No changes are needed in RPC support provided by Hadoop to enable\ncommunication done by components of your application.\n\n\nHDFS\n\n\nHadoop includes a highly fault tolerant, high throughput\ndistributed file system (\nHDFS\n).\nIt runs on commodity hardware, and your streaming application will, by\ndefault, use it. There is no difference between files created by a\nstreaming application and those created by map-reduce.\n\n\nDeveloping An Application\n\n\nIn this chapter we describe the methodology to develop an\napplication using the Realtime Streaming Platform. The platform was\ndesigned to make it easy to build and launch sophisticated streaming\napplications with the developer having to deal only with the\napplication/business logic. The platform deals with details of where to\nrun what operators on which servers and how to correctly route streams\nof data among them.\n\n\nDevelopment Process\n\n\nWhile the platform does not mandate a specific methodology or set\nof development tools, we have recommendations to maximize productivity\nfor the different phases of application development.\n\n\nDesign\n\n\n\n\nIdentify common, reusable operators. Use a library\n    if possible.\n\n\nIdentify scalability and performance requirements before\n    designing the DAG.\n\n\nLeverage attributes that the platform supports for scalability\n    and performance.\n\n\nUse operators that are benchmarked and tested so that later\n    surprises are minimized. If you have glue code, create appropriate\n    unit tests for it.\n\n\nUse THREAD_LOCAL locality for high throughput streams. If all\n    the operators on that stream cannot fit in one container,\n    try\u00a0NODE_LOCAL\u00a0locality. Both THREAD_LOCAL and\n    NODE_LOCAL streams avoid the Network Interface Card (NIC)\n    completely. The former uses intra-process communication to also avoid\n    serialization-deserialization overhead.\n\n\nThe overall throughput and latencies are are not necessarily\n    correlated to the number of operators in a simple way -- the\n    relationship is more nuanced. A lot depends on how much work\n    individual operators are doing, how many are able to operate in\n    parallel, and how much data is flowing through the arcs of the DAG.\n    It is, at times, better to break a computation down into its\n    constituent simple parts and then stitch them together via streams\n    to better utilize the compute resources of the cluster. Decide on a\n    per application basis the fine line between complexity of each\n    operator vs too many streams. Doing multiple computations in one\n    operator does save network I/O, while operators that are too complex\n    are hard to maintain.\n\n\nDo not use operators that depend on the order of two streams\n    as far as possible. In such cases behavior is not idempotent.\n\n\nPersist key information to HDFS if possible; it may be useful\n    for debugging later.\n\n\nDecide on an appropriate fault tolerance mechanism. If some\n    data loss is acceptable, use the at-most-once mechanism as it has\n    fastest recovery.\n\n\n\n\nCreating New Project\n\n\nPlease refer to the \nApex Application Packages\n\u00a0for\nthe basic steps for creating a new project.\n\n\nWriting the application code\n\n\nPreferably use an IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans etc.) that allows you to\nmanage dependencies and assists with the Java coding. Specific benefits\ninclude ease of managing operator library jar files, individual operator\nclasses, ports and properties. It will also highlight and assist to\nrectify issues such as type mismatches when adding streams while\ntyping.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nWrite test cases with JUnit or similar test framework so that code\nis tested as it is written. For such testing, the DAG can run in local\nmode within the IDE. Doing this may involve writing mock input or output\noperators for the integration points with external systems. For example,\ninstead of reading from a live data stream, the application in test mode\ncan read from and write to files. This can be done with a single\napplication DAG by instrumenting a test mode using settings in the\nconfiguration that is passed to the application factory\ninterface.\n\n\nGood test coverage will not only eliminate basic validation errors\nsuch as missing port connections or property constraint violations, but\nalso validate the correct processing of the data. The same tests can be\nre-run whenever the application or its dependencies change (operator\nlibraries, version of the platform etc.)\n\n\nRunning an application\n\n\nThe platform provides a command line tool called Apex CLI (apex)\u00a0for managing applications (launching,\nkilling, viewing, etc.). This tool was already discussed above briefly\nin the section entitled Running the Test Application. It will introspect\nthe jar file specified with the launch command for applications (classes\nthat implement ApplicationFactory) or property files that define\napplications. It will also deploy the dependency jar files from the\napplication package to the cluster.\n\n\nApex CLI can run the application in local mode (i.e. outside a\ncluster). It is recommended to first run the application in local mode\nin the development environment before launching on the Hadoop cluster.\nThis way some of the external system integration and correct\nfunctionality of the application can be verified in an easier to debug\nenvironment before testing distributed mode.\n\n\nFor more details on CLI please refer to the \nApex CLI Guide\n.\n\n\nApplication API\n\n\nThis section introduces the API to write a streaming application.\nThe work involves connecting operators via streams to form the logical\nDAG. The steps are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstantiate an application (DAG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Set Attributes\n\n\n\n\nAssign application name\n\n\nSet any other attributes as per application requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate/re-use and instantiate operators\n\n\n\n\nAssign operator name that is unique within the  application\n\n\nDeclare schema upfront for each operator (and thereby its  \nports\n)\n\n\n(Optional) Set \nproperties\n\u00a0\n and \nattributes\n\u00a0\n on the dag as per specification\n\n\nConnect ports of operators via streams\n\n\nEach stream connects one output port of an operator to one or  more input ports of other operators.\n\n\n(Optional) Set attributes on the streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two methods to create an application, namely Java, and\nProperties file. Java API is for applications being developed by humans,\nand properties file (Hadoop like) is more suited for DAGs generated by\ntools.\n\n\nJava API\n\n\nThe Java API is the most common way to create a streaming\napplication. It is meant for application developers who prefer to\nleverage the features of Java, and the ease of use and enhanced\nproductivity provided by IDEs like NetBeans or Eclipse. Using Java to\nspecify the application provides extra validation abilities of Java\ncompiler, such as compile time checks for type safety at the time of\nwriting the code. Later in this chapter you can read more about\nvalidation support in the platform.\n\n\nThe developer specifies the streaming application by implementing\nthe ApplicationFactory interface, which is how platform tools (CLI etc.)\nrecognize and instantiate applications. Here we show how to create a\nYahoo! Finance application that streams the last trade price of a ticker\nand computes the high and low price in every 1 min window. Run above\n test application\u00a0to execute the\nDAG in local mode within the IDE.\n\n\nLet us revisit how the Yahoo! Finance test application constructs the DAG:\n\n\npublic class Application implements StreamingApplication\n{\n\n  ...\n\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration conf)\n  {\n    dag.getAttributes().attr(DAG.STRAM_WINDOW_SIZE_MILLIS).set(streamingWindowSizeMilliSeconds);\n\n    StockTickInput tick = getStockTickInputOperator(\nStockTickInput\n, dag);\n    SumKeyVal\nString, Long\n dailyVolume = getDailyVolumeOperator(\nDailyVolume\n, dag);\n    ConsolidatorKeyVal\nString,Double,Long,String,?,?\n quoteOperator = getQuoteOperator(\nQuote\n, dag);\n\n    RangeKeyVal\nString, Double\n highlow = getHighLowOperator(\nHighLow\n, dag, appWindowCountMinute);\n    SumKeyVal\nString, Long\n minuteVolume = getMinuteVolumeOperator(\nMinuteVolume\n, dag, appWindowCountMinute);\n    ConsolidatorKeyVal\nString,HighLow,Long,?,?,?\n chartOperator = getChartOperator(\nChart\n, dag);\n\n    SimpleMovingAverage\nString, Double\n priceSMA = getPriceSimpleMovingAverageOperator(\nPriceSMA\n, dag, appWindowCountSMA);\n\n    dag.addStream(\nprice\n, tick.price, quoteOperator.in1, highlow.data, priceSMA.data);\n    dag.addStream(\nvol\n, tick.volume, dailyVolume.data, minuteVolume.data);\n    dag.addStream(\ntime\n, tick.time, quoteOperator.in3);\n    dag.addStream(\ndaily_vol\n, dailyVolume.sum, quoteOperator.in2);\n\n    dag.addStream(\nquote_data\n, quoteOperator.out, getConsole(\nquoteConsole\n, dag, \nQUOTE\n));\n\n    dag.addStream(\nhigh_low\n, highlow.range, chartOperator.in1);\n    dag.addStream(\nvol_1min\n, minuteVolume.sum, chartOperator.in2);\n    dag.addStream(\nchart_data\n, chartOperator.out, getConsole(\nchartConsole\n, dag, \nCHART\n));\n\n    dag.addStream(\nsma_price\n, priceSMA.doubleSMA, getConsole(\npriceSMAConsole\n, dag, \nPrice SMA\n));\n\n    return dag;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nProperty File API\n\n\nThe platform also supports specification of a DAG via a property\nfile. The aim here to make it easy for tools to create and run an\napplication. This method of specification does not have the Java\ncompiler support of compile time check, but since these applications\nwould be created by software, they should be correct by construction.\nThe syntax is derived from Hadoop properties and should be easy for\nfolks who are used to creating software that integrated with\nHadoop.\n\n\nCreate an application (DAG): myApplication.properties\n\n\n# input operator that reads from a file\ndt.operator.inputOp.classname=com.acme.SampleInputOperator\ndt.operator.inputOp.fileName=somefile.txt\n\n# output operator that writes to the console\ndt.operator.outputOp.classname=com.acme.ConsoleOutputOperator\n\n# stream connecting both operators\ndt.stream.inputStream.source=inputOp.outputPort\ndt.stream.inputStream.sinks=outputOp.inputPort\n\n\n\n\nAbove snippet is intended to convey the basic idea of specifying\nthe DAG without using Java. Operators would come from a predefined\nlibrary and referenced in the specification by class name and port names\n(obtained from the library providers documentation or runtime\nintrospection by tools). For those interested in details, see later\nsections and refer to the  Operation and\nInstallation Guide\u00a0mentioned above.\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nAttributes impact the runtime behavior of the application. They do\nnot impact the functionality. An example of an attribute is application\nname. Setting it changes the application name. Another example is\nstreaming window size. Setting it changes the streaming window size from\nthe default value to the specified value. Users cannot add new\nattributes, they can only choose from the ones that come packaged and\npre-supported by the platform. Details of attributes are covered in the\n Operation and Installation\nGuide.\n\n\nOperators\n\n\nOperators\u00a0are basic compute units.\nOperators process each incoming tuple and emit zero or more tuples on\noutput ports as per the business logic. The data flow, connectivity,\nfault tolerance (node outage), etc. is taken care of by the platform. As\nan operator developer, all that is needed is to figure out what to do\nwith the incoming tuple and when (and which output port) to send out a\nparticular output tuple. Correctly designed operators will most likely\nget reused. Operator design needs care and foresight. For details, refer\nto the  \nOperator Developer Guide\n. As an application developer you need to connect operators\nin a way that it implements your business logic. You may also require\noperator customization for functionality and use attributes for\nperformance/scalability etc.\n\n\nAll operators process tuples asynchronously in a distributed\ncluster. An operator cannot assume or predict the exact time a tuple\nthat it emitted will get consumed by a downstream operator. An operator\nalso cannot predict the exact time when a tuple arrives from an upstream\noperator. The only guarantee is that the upstream operators are\nprocessing the current or a future window, i.e. the windowId of upstream\noperator is equals or exceeds its own windowId. Conversely the windowId\nof a downstream operator is less than or equals its own windowId. The\nend of a window operation, i.e. the API call to endWindow on an operator\nrequires that all upstream operators have finished processing this\nwindow. This means that completion of processing a window propagates in\na blocking fashion through an operator. Later sections provides more\ndetails on streams and data flow of tuples.\n\n\nEach operator has a unique name within the DAG as provided by the\nuser. This is the name of the operator in the logical plan. The name of\nthe operator in the physical plan is an integer assigned to it by STRAM.\nThese integers are use the sequence from 1 to N, where N is total number\nof physically unique operators in the DAG. \u00a0Following the same rule,\neach partitioned instance of a logical operator has its own integer as\nan id. This id along with the Hadoop container name uniquely identifies\nthe operator in the execution plan of the DAG. The logical names and the\nphysical names are required for web service support. Operators can be\naccessed via both names. These same names are used while interacting\nwith Apex CLI\u00a0to access an operator.\nIdeally these names should be self-descriptive. For example in Figure 1,\nthe node named \u201cDaily volume\u201d has a physical identifier of 2.\n\n\nOperator Interface\n\n\nOperator interface in a DAG consists of \nports\n,\n\u00a0\nproperties\n,\n\u00a0and\n \nattributes\n\n\n.\n\u00a0Operators interact with other\ncomponents of the DAG via ports. Functional behavior of the operators\ncan be customized via parameters. Run time performance and physical\ninstantiation is controlled by attributes. Ports and parameters are\nfields (variables) of the Operator class/object, while attributes are\nmeta information that is attached to the operator object via an\nAttributeMap. An operator must have at least one port. Properties are\noptional. Attributes are provided by the platform and always have a\ndefault value that enables normal functioning of operators.\n\n\nPorts\n\n\nPorts are connection points by which an operator receives and\nemits tuples. These should be transient objects instantiated in the\noperator object, that implement particular interfaces. Ports should be\ntransient as they contain no state. They have a pre-defined schema and\ncan only be connected to other ports with the same schema. An input port\nneeds to implement the interface  Operator.InputPort\u00a0and\ninterface Sink. A default\nimplementation of these is provided by the abstract class DefaultInputPort. An output port needs to\nimplement the interface  Operator.OutputPort. A default implementation\nof this is provided by the concrete class DefaultOutputPort. These two are a quick way to\nimplement the above interfaces, but operator developers have the option\nof providing their own implementations.\n\n\nHere are examples of an input and an output port from the operator\nSum.\n\n\n@InputPortFieldAnnotation(name = \ndata\n)\npublic final transient DefaultInputPort\nV\n data = new DefaultInputPort\nV\n() {\n  @Override\n  public void process(V tuple)\n  {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n@OutputPortFieldAnnotation(optional=true)\npublic final transient DefaultOutputPort\nV\n sum = new DefaultOutputPort\nV\n(){ \u2026 };\n\n\n\n\nThe process call is in the Sink interface. An emit on an output\nport is done via emit(tuple) call. For the above example it would be\nsum.emit(t), where the type of t is the generic parameter V.\n\n\nThere is no limit on how many ports an operator can have. However\nany operator must have at least one port. An operator with only one port\nis called an Input Adapter if it has no input port and an Output Adapter\nif it has no output port. These are special operators needed to get/read\ndata from outside system/source into the application, or push/write data\ninto an outside system/sink. These could be in Hadoop or outside of\nHadoop. These two operators are in essence gateways for the streaming\napplication to communicate with systems outside the application.\n\n\nPort connectivity can be validated during compile time by adding\nPortFieldAnnotations shown above. By default all ports have to be\nconnected, to allow a port to go unconnected, you need to add\n\u201coptional=true\u201d to the annotation.\n\n\nAttributes can be specified for ports that affect the runtime\nbehavior. An example of an attribute is parallel partition that specifes\na parallel computation flow per partition. It is described in detail in\nthe \nParallel\nPartitions\n\u00a0\nsection.\nAnother example is queue capacity that specifies the buffer size for the\nport. Details of attributes are covered in  Operation and Installation Guide.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nProperties are the abstractions by which functional behavior of an\noperator can be customized. They should be non-transient objects\ninstantiated in the operator object. They need to be non-transient since\nthey are part of the operator state and re-construction of the operator\nobject from its checkpointed state must restore the operator to the\ndesired state. Properties are optional, i.e. an operator may or may not\nhave properties; they are part of user code and their values are not\ninterpreted by the platform in any way.\n\n\nAll non-serializable objects should be declared transient.\nExamples include sockets, session information, etc. These objects should\nbe initialized during setup call, which is called every time the\noperator is initialized.\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nAttributes are values assigned to the operators that impact\nrun-time. This includes things like the number of partitions, at most\nonce or at least once or exactly once recovery modes, etc. Attributes do\nnot impact functionality of the operator. Users can change certain\nattributes in runtime. Users cannot add attributes to operators; they\nare pre-defined by the platform. They are interpreted by the platform\nand thus cannot be defined in user created code (like properties).\nDetails of attributes are covered in  \nConfiguration Guide\n.\n\n\nOperator State\n\n\nThe state of an operator is defined as the data that it transfers\nfrom one window to a future window. Since the computing model of the\nplatform is to treat windows like micro-batches, the operator state can\nbe \ncheckpointed\n\u00a0\nevery\nNth window, or every T units of time, where T is significantly greater\nthan the streaming window. \u00a0When an operator is checkpointed, the entire\nobject is written to HDFS. \u00a0The larger the amount of state in an\noperator, the longer it takes to recover from a failure. A stateless\noperator can recover much quicker than a stateful one. The needed\nwindows are preserved by the upstream buffer server and are used to\nrecompute the lost windows, and also rebuild the buffer server in the\ncurrent container.\n\n\nThe distinction between Stateless and Stateful is based solely on\nthe need to transfer data in the operator from one window to the next.\nThe state of an operator is independent of the number of ports.\n\n\nStateless\n\n\nA Stateless operator is defined as one where no data is needed to\nbe kept at the end of every window. This means that all the computations\nof a window can be derived from all the tuples the operator receives\nwithin that window. This guarantees that the output of any window can be\nreconstructed by simply replaying the tuples that arrived in that\nwindow. Stateless operators are more efficient in terms of fault\ntolerance, and cost to achieve SLA.\n\n\nStateful\n\n\nA Stateful operator is defined as one where data is needed to be\nstored at the end of a window for computations occurring in later\nwindow; a common example is the computation of a sum of values in the\ninput tuples.\n\n\nOperator API\n\n\nThe Operator API consists of methods that operator developers may\nneed to override. In this section we will discuss the Operator APIs from\nthe point of view of an application developer. Knowledge of how an\noperator works internally is critical for writing an application. Those\ninterested in the details should refer to  Malhar Operator Developer Guide.\n\n\nThe APIs are available in three modes, namely Single Streaming\nWindow, Sliding Application Window, and Aggregate Application Window.\nThese are not mutually exclusive, i.e. an operator can use single\nstreaming window as well as sliding application window. A physical\ninstance of an operator is always processing tuples from a single\nwindow. The processing of tuples is guaranteed to be sequential, no\nmatter which input port the tuples arrive on.\n\n\nIn the later part of this section we will evaluate three common\nuses of streaming windows by applications. They have different\ncharacteristics and implications on optimization and recovery mechanisms\n(i.e. algorithm used to recover a node after outage) as discussed later\nin the section.\n\n\nStreaming Window\n\n\nStreaming window is atomic micro-batch computation period. The API\nmethods relating to a streaming window are as follows\n\n\npublic void process(\ntuple_type\n tuple) // Called on the input port on which the tuple arrives\npublic void beginWindow(long windowId) // Called at the start of the window as soon as the first begin_window tuple arrives\npublic void endWindow() // Called at the end of the window after end_window tuples arrive on all input ports\npublic void setup(OperatorContext context) // Called once during initialization of the operator\npublic void teardown() // Called once when the operator is being shutdown\n\n\n\n\nA tuple can be emitted in any of the three streaming run-time\ncalls, namely beginWindow, process, and endWindow but not in setup or\nteardown.\n\n\nAggregate Application Window\n\n\nAn operator with an aggregate window is stateful within the\napplication window timeframe and possibly stateless at the end of that\napplication window. An size of an aggregate application window is an\noperator attribute and is defined as a multiple of the streaming window\nsize. The platform recognizes this attribute and optimizes the operator.\nThe beginWindow, and endWindow calls are not invoked for those streaming\nwindows that do not align with the application window. For example in\ncase of streaming window of 0.5 second and application window of 5\nminute, an application window spans 600 streaming windows (5*60*2 =\n600). At the start of the sequence of these 600 atomic streaming\nwindows, a beginWindow gets invoked, and at the end of these 600\nstreaming windows an endWindow gets invoked. All the intermediate\nstreaming windows do not invoke beginWindow or endWindow. Bookkeeping,\nnode recovery, stats, UI, etc. continue to work off streaming windows.\nFor example if operators are being checkpointed say on an average every\n30th window, then the above application window would have about 20\ncheckpoints.\n\n\nSliding Application Window\n\n\nA sliding window is computations that requires previous N\nstreaming windows. After each streaming window the Nth past window is\ndropped and the new window is added to the computation. An operator with\nsliding window is a stateful operator at end of any window. The sliding\nwindow period is an attribute and is a multiple of streaming window. The\nplatform recognizes this attribute and leverages it during bookkeeping.\nA sliding aggregate window with tolerance to data loss does not have a\nvery high bookkeeping cost. The cost of all three recovery mechanisms,\n at most once\u00a0(data loss tolerant),\nat least once\u00a0(data loss\nintolerant), and exactly once\u00a0(data\nloss intolerant and no extra computations) is same as recovery\nmechanisms based on streaming window. STRAM is not able to leverage this\noperator for any extra optimization.\n\n\nSingle vs Multi-Input Operator\n\n\nA single-input operator by definition has a single upstream\noperator, since there can only be one writing port for a stream. \u00a0If an\noperator has a single upstream operator, then the beginWindow on the\nupstream also blocks the beginWindow of the single-input operator. For\nan operator to start processing any window at least one upstream\noperator has to start processing that window. A multi-input operator\nreads from more than one upstream ports. Such an operator would start\nprocessing as soon as the first begin_window event arrives. However the\nwindow would not close (i.e. invoke endWindow) till all ports receive\nend_window events for that windowId. Thus the end of a window is a\nblocking event. As we saw earlier, a multi-input operator is also the\npoint in the DAG where windows of all upstream operators are\nsynchronized. The windows (atomic micro-batches) from a faster (or just\nahead in processing) upstream operators are queued up till the slower\nupstream operator catches up. STRAM monitors such bottlenecks and takes\ncorrective actions. The platform ensures minimal delay, i.e processing\nstarts as long as at least one upstream operator has started\nprocessing.\n\n\nRecovery Mechanisms\n\n\nApplication developers can set any of the recovery mechanisms\nbelow to deal with node outage. In general, the cost of recovery depends\non the state of the operator, while data integrity is dependant on the\napplication. The mechanisms are per window as the platform treats\nwindows as atomic compute units. Three recovery mechanisms are\nsupported, namely\n\n\n\n\nAt-least-once: All atomic batches are processed at least once.\n    No data loss occurs.\n\n\nAt-most-once: All atomic batches are processed at most once.\n    Data loss is possible; this is the most efficient setting.\n\n\nExactly-once: All atomic batches are processed exactly once.\n    No data loss occurs; this is the least efficient setting since\n    additional work is needed to ensure proper semantics.\n\n\n\n\nAt-least-once is the default. During a recovery event, the\noperator connects to the upstream buffer server and asks for windows to\nbe replayed. At-least-once and exactly-once mechanisms start from its\ncheckpointed state. At-most-once starts from the next begin-window\nevent.\n\n\nRecovery mechanisms can be specified per Operator while writing\nthe application as shown below.\n\n\nOperator o = dag.addOperator(\u201coperator\u201d, \u2026);\ndag.setAttribute(o,  OperatorContext.PROCESSING_MODE,  ProcessingMode.AT_MOST_ONCE);\n\n\n\n\nAlso note that once an operator is attributed to AT_MOST_ONCE,\nall the operators downstream to it have to be AT_MOST_ONCE. The client\nwill give appropriate warnings or errors if that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\nDetails are explained in the chapter on Fault Tolerance\nbelow\n.\n\n\nStreams\n\n\nA stream\u00a0is a connector\n(edge) abstraction, and is a fundamental building block of the platform.\nA stream consists of tuples that flow from one port (called the\noutput\u00a0port) to one or more ports\non other operators (called  input\u00a0ports) another -- so note a potentially\nconfusing aspect of this terminology: tuples enter a stream through its\noutput port and leave via one or more input ports. A stream has the\nfollowing characteristics\n\n\n\n\nTuples are always delivered in the same order in which they\n    were emitted.\n\n\nConsists of a sequence of windows one after another. Each\n    window being a collection of in-order tuples.\n\n\nA stream that connects two containers passes through a\n    buffer server.\n\n\nAll streams can be persisted (by default in HDFS).\n\n\nExactly one output port writes to the stream.\n\n\nCan be read by one or more input ports.\n\n\nConnects operators within an application, not outside\n    an application.\n\n\nHas an unique name within an application.\n\n\nHas attributes which act as hints to STRAM.\n\n\n\n\nStreams have four modes, namely in-line, in-node, in-rack,\n    and other. Modes may be overruled (for example due to lack\n    of containers). They are defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nTHREAD_LOCAL: In the same thread, uses thread\n    stack (intra-thread). This mode can only be used for a downstream\n    operator which has only one input port connected; also called\n    in-line.\n\n\nCONTAINER_LOCAL: In the same container (intra-process); also\n    called in-container.\n\n\nNODE_LOCAL: In the same Hadoop node (inter processes, skips\n    NIC); also called in-node.\n\n\nRACK_LOCAL: On nodes in the same rack; also called\n    in-rack.\n\n\nunspecified: No guarantee. Could be anywhere within the\n    cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a stream declaration is given below\n\n\nDAG dag = new DAG();\n \u2026\ndag.addStream(\nviews\n, viewAggregate.sum, cost.data).setLocality(CONTAINER_LOCAL); // A container local  stream\ndag.addStream(\u201cclicks\u201d, clickAggregate.sum, rev.data); // An example of unspecified locality\n\n\n\n\nThe platform guarantees in-order delivery of tuples in a stream.\nSTRAM views each stream as collection of ordered windows. Since no tuple\ncan exist outside a window, a replay of a stream consists of replay of a\nset of windows. When multiple input ports read the same stream, the\nexecution plan of a stream ensures that each input port is logically not\nblocked by the reading of another input port. The schema of a stream is\nsame as the schema of the tuple.\n\n\nIn a stream all tuples emitted by an operator in a window belong\nto that window. A replay of this window would consists of an in-order\nreplay of all the tuples. Thus the tuple order within a stream is\nguaranteed. However since an operator may receive multiple streams (for\nexample an operator with two input ports), the order of arrival of two\ntuples belonging to different streams is not guaranteed. In general in\nan asynchronous distributed architecture this is expected. Thus the\noperator (specially one with multiple input ports) should not depend on\nthe tuple order from two streams. One way to cope with this\nindeterminate order, if necessary, is to wait to get all the tuples of a\nwindow and emit results in endWindow call. All operator templates\nprovided as part of  \nstandard operator template\nlibrary\n \n\u00a0\nfollow\nthese principles.\n\n\nA logical stream gets partitioned into physical streams each\nconnecting the partition to the upstream operator. If two different\nattributes are needed on the same stream, it should be split using\nStreamDuplicator\u00a0operator.\n\n\nModes of the streams are critical for performance. An in-line\nstream is the most optimal as it simply delivers the tuple as-is without\nserialization-deserialization. Streams should be marked\ncontainer_local, specially in case where there is a large tuple volume\nbetween two operators which then on drops significantly. Since the\nsetLocality call merely provides a hint, STRAM may ignore it. An In-node\nstream is not as efficient as an in-line one, but it is clearly better\nthan going off-node since it still avoids the potential bottleneck of\nthe network card.\n\n\nTHREAD_LOCAL and CONTAINER_LOCAL streams do not use a buffer\nserver as this stream is in a single process. The other two do.\n\n\nValidating an Application\n\n\nThe platform provides various ways of validating the application\nspecification and data input. An understanding of these checks is very\nimportant for an application developer since it affects productivity.\nValidation of an application is done in three phases, namely\n\n\n\n\nCompile Time: Caught during application development, and is\n    most cost effective. These checks are mainly done on declarative\n    objects and leverages the Java compiler. An example is checking that\n    the schemas specified on all ports of a stream are\n    mutually compatible.\n\n\nInitialization Time: When the application is being\n    initialized, before submitting to Hadoop. These checks are related\n    to configuration/context of an application, and are done by the\n    logical DAG builder implementation. An example is the checking that\n    all non-optional ports are connected to other ports.\n\n\nRun Time: Validations done when the application is running.\n    This is the costliest of all checks. These are checks that can only\n    be done at runtime as they involve data. For example divide by 0\n    check as part of business logic.\n\n\n\n\nCompile Time\n\n\nCompile time validations apply when an application is specified in\nJava code and include all checks that can be done by Java compiler in\nthe development environment (including IDEs like NetBeans or Eclipse).\nExamples include\n\n\n\n\nSchema Validation: The tuples on ports are POJO (plain old\n    java objects) and compiler checks to ensure that all the ports on a\n    stream have the same schema.\n\n\nStream Check: Single Output Port and at least one Input port\n    per stream. A stream can only have one output port writer. This is\n    part of the addStream api. This\n    check ensures that developers only connect one output port to\n    a stream. The same signature also ensures that there is at least one\n    input port for a stream\n\n\nNaming: Compile time checks ensures that applications\n    components operators, streams are named\n\n\n\n\nInitialization/Instantiation Time\n\n\nInitialization time validations include various checks that are\ndone post compile, and before the application starts running in a\ncluster (or local mode). These are mainly configuration/contextual in\nnature. These checks are as critical to proper functionality of the\napplication as the compile time validations.\n\n\nExamples include\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaBeans Validation\n:\n    Examples include\n\n\n\n\n@Max(): Value must be less than or equal to the number\n\n\n@Min(): Value must be greater than or equal to the\n    number\n\n\n@NotNull: The value of the field or property must not be\n    null\n\n\n@Pattern(regexp = \u201c....\u201d): Value must match the regular\n    expression\n\n\nInput port connectivity: By default, every non-optional input\n    port must be connected. A port can be declared optional by using an\n    annotation: \u00a0 \u00a0 @InputPortFieldAnnotation(name = \"...\", optional\n    = true)\n\n\nOutput Port Connectivity: Similar. The annotation here is: \u00a0 \u00a0\n    @OutputPortFieldAnnotation(name = \"...\", optional = true)\n\n\n@Valid: For nested property validation \n a property should have this\n    annotation if its value  is itself an object whose properties\n    need to be validated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique names in application scope: Operators, streams, must have\n    unique names.\n\n\n\n\nCycles in the dag: DAG cannot have a cycle.\n\n\nUnique names in operator scope: Ports, properties, annotations\n    must have unique names.\n\n\nOne stream per port: A port can connect to only one stream.\n    This check applies to input as well as output ports even though an\n    output port can technically write to two streams. If you must have\n    two streams originating from a single output port, use \u00a0a\u00a0streamDuplicator operator.\n\n\nApplication Window Period: Has to be an integral multiple the\n    streaming window period.\n\n\n\n\nRun Time\n\n\nRun time checks are those that are done when the application is\nrunning. The real-time streaming platform provides rich run time error\nhandling mechanisms. The checks are exclusively done by the application\nbusiness logic, but the platform allows applications to count and audit\nthese. Some of these features are in the process of development (backend\nand UI) and this section will be updated as they are developed. Upon\ncompletion examples will be added to  \ndemos\n \nt\no\nillustrate these.\n\n\nError ports are output ports with error annotations. Since they\nare normal ports, they can be monitored and tuples counted, persisted\nand counts shown in the UI.\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Tenancy and Security\n\n\nHadoop is a multi-tenant distributed operating system. Security is\nan intrinsic element of multi-tenancy as without it a cluster cannot be\nreasonably be shared among enterprise applications. Streaming\napplications follow all multi-tenancy security models used in Hadoop as\nthey are native Hadoop applications. For details refer to the\n\nOperation and Installation\nGuide\n\n.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nThe platform includes Kerberos support. Both access points, namely\nSTRAM and Bufferserver are secure. STRAM passes the token over to\nStreamingContainer, which then gives it to the Bufferserver. The most\nimportant aspect for an application developer is to note that STRAM is\nthe single point of access to ensure security measures are taken by all\ncomponents of the platform.\n\n\nResource Limits\n\n\nHadoop enforces quotas on resources. This includes hard-disk (name\nspace and total disk quota) as well as priority queues for schedulers.\nThe platform uses Hadoop resource limits to manage a streaming\napplication. In addition network I/O quotas can be enforced. An operator\ncan be dynamically partitioned if it reaches its resource limits; these\nlimits may be expressed in terms of throughput, latency, or just\naggregate resource utilization of a container.\n\n\n\n\nScalability and Partitioning\n\n\nScalability is a foundational element of this platform and is a\nbuilding block for an eco-system where big-data meets real-time.\nEnterprises need to continually meet SLA as data grows. Without the\nability to scale as load grows, or new applications with higher loads\ncome to fruition, enterprise grade SLA cannot be met. A big issue with\nthe streaming application space is that, it is not just about high load,\nbut also the fluctuations in it. There is no way to guarantee future\nload requirements and there is a big difference between high and low\nload within a day for the same feed. Traditional streaming platforms\nsolve these two cases by simply throwing more hardware at the\nproblem.\n\n\nDaily spikes are managed by ensuring enough hardware for peak\nload, which then idles during low load, and future needs are handled by\na very costly re-architecture, or investing heavily in building a\nscalable distributed operating system. Another salient and often\noverlooked cost is the need to manage SLA -- let\u2019s call it  buffer capacity. Since this means computing the\npeak load within required time, that translates to allocating enough\nresources over and above peak load as daily peaks fluctuate. For example\nan average peak load of 100 resource units (cpu and/or memory and/or\nnetwork) may mean allocating about 200 resource units to be safe. A\ndistributed cluster that cannot dynamically scale up and down, in effect\npays buffer capacity per application. Another big aspect of streaming\napplications is that the load is not just ingestion rate, more often\nthan not, the internal operators produce lot more events than the\ningestion rate. For example a dimensional data (with, say  d\u00a0dimensions) computation needs 2*d -1\u00a0computations per ingested event. A lot\nof applications have over 10 dimensions, i.e over 1000 computations per\nincoming event and these need to be distributed across the cluster,\nthereby causing an explosion in the throughput (events/sec) that needs\nto be managed.\n\n\nThe platform is designed to handle such cases at a very low cost.\nThe platform scales linearly with Hadoop. If applications need more\nresources, the enterprise can simply add more commodity nodes to Hadoop\nwithout any downtime, and the Hadoop native platform will take care of\nthe rest. If some nodes go bad, these can be removed without downtime.\nThe daily peaks and valleys in the load are managed by the platform by\ndynamically scaling at the peak and then giving the resources back to\nHadoop during low load. This means that a properly designed Hadoop\ncluster does several things for enterprises: (a) reduces the cost of\nhardware due to use of commodity hardware (b) shares buffer capacity\nacross all applications as peaks of all applications may not align and\n(c) raises the average CPU usage on a 24x7 basis. As a general design\nthis is similar to scale that a map-reduce application can deliver. In\nthe following sections of this chapter we will see how this is\ndone.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\nIf all tuples sent through the stream(s) that are connected to the\ninput port(s) of an operator in the DAG are received by a single\nphysical instance of that operator, that operator can become a\nperformance bottleneck. This leads to scalability issues when\nthroughput, memory, or CPU needs exceed the processing capacity of that\nsingle instance.\n\n\nTo address the problem, the platform offers the capability to\npartition the inflow of data so that it is divided across multiple\nphysical instances of a logical operator in the DAG. There are two\nfunctional ways to partition\n\n\n\n\nLoad balance: Incoming load is simply partitioned\n    into stream(s) that go to separate instances of physical operators\n    and scalability is achieved via adding more physical operators. Each\n    tuple is sent to physical operator (partition) based on a\n    round-robin or other similar algorithm. This scheme scales linearly.\n    A lot of key based computations can load balance in the platform due\n    to the ability to insert  Unifiers. For many computations, the\n    endWindow and Unifier setup is similar to the combiner and reducer\n    mechanism in a Map-Reduce computation.\n\n\nSticky Key: The key assertion is that distribution of tuples\n    are sticky, i.e the data with\n    same key will always be processed by the same physical operator, no\n    matter how many times it is sent through the stream. This stickiness\n    will continue even if the number of partitions grows dynamically and\n    can eventually be leveraged for advanced features like\n    bucket testing. How this is accomplished and what is required to\n    develop compliant operators will be explained below.\n\n\n\n\nWe plan to add more partitioning mechanisms proactively to the\nplatform over time as needed by emerging usage patterns. The aim is to\nallow enterprises to be able to focus on their business logic, and\nsignificantly reduce the cost of operability. As an enabling technology\nfor managing high loads, this platform provides enterprises with a\nsignificant innovative edge. Scalability and Partitioning is a\nfoundational building block for this platform.\n\n\nSticky Partition vs Round Robin\n\n\nAs noted above, partitioning via sticky key is data aware but\nround-robin partitioning is not. An example for non-sticky load\nbalancing would be round robin distribution over multiple instances,\nwhere for example a tuple stream of  A, A,\nA with 3 physical operator\ninstances would result in processing of a single A by each of the instances, In contrast, sticky\npartitioning means that exactly one instance of the operators will\nprocess all of the  Atuples if they\nfall into the same bucket, while B\nmay be processed by another operator. Data aware mapping of\ntuples to partitions (similar to distributed hash table) is accomplished\nvia Stream Codecs. In later sections we would show how these two\napproaches can be used in combination.\n\n\nStream Codec\n\n\nThe platform does not make assumptions about the tuple\ntype, it could be any Java object. The operator developer knows what\ntuple type an input port expects and is capable of processing. Each\ninput port has a stream codec \u00a0associated thatdefines how data is serialized when transmitted over a socket\nstream; it also defines another\nfunction that computes the partition hash key for the tuple. The engine\nuses that key to determine which physical instance(s) \u00a0(for a\npartitioned operator) receive that \u00a0tuple. For this to work, consistent hashing is required.\nThe default codec uses the Java Object#hashCode function, which is\nsufficient for basic types such as Integer, String etc. It will also\nwork with custom tuple classes as long as they implement hashCode\nappropriately. Reliance on hashCode may not work when generic containers\nare used that do not hash the actual data, such as standard collection\nclasses (HashMap etc.), in which case a custom stream codec must be\nassigned to the input port.\n\n\nStatic Partitioning\n\n\nDAG designers can specify at design time how they would like\ncertain operators to be partitioned. STRAM then instantiates the DAG\nwith the physical plan which adheres to the partitioning scheme defined\nby the design. This plan is the initial partition of the application. In\nother words, Static Partitioning is used to tell STRAM to compute the\nphysical DAG from a logical DAG once, without taking into consideration\nruntime states or loads of various operators.\n\n\nDynamic Partitioning\n\n\nIn streaming applications the load changes during the day, thus\ncreating situations where the number of partitioned operator instances\nneeds to adjust dynamically. The load can be measured in terms of\nprocessing within the DAG based on throughput, or latency, or\nconsiderations in external system components (time based etc.) that the\nplatform may not be aware of. Whatever the trigger, the resource\nrequirement for the current processing needs to be adjusted at run-time.\nThe platform may detect that operator instances are over or under\nutilized and may need to dynamically adjust the number of instances on\nthe fly. More instances of a logical operator may be required (partition\nsplit) or underutilized operator instances may need decommissioning\n(partition merge). We refer to either of the changes as dynamic\npartitioning. The default partitioning scheme supports split and merge\nof partitions, but without state transfer. The contract of the\nPartitioner\u00a0interface allows the operator\ndeveloper to implement split/merge and the associated state transfer, if\nnecessary.\n\n\nSince partitioning is a key scalability measure, our goal is to\nmake it as simple as possible without removing the flexibility needed\nfor sophisticated applications. Basic partitioning can be enabled at\ncompile time through the DAG specification. A slightly involved\npartitioning involves writing custom codecs to calculate data aware\npartitioning scheme. More complex partitioning cases may require users\nto provide a custom implementation of Partitioner, which gives the\ndeveloper full control over state transfer between multiple instances of\nthe partitioned operator.\n\n\nDefault Partitioning\n\n\nThe platform provides a default partitioning implementation that\ncan be enabled without implementing Partitioner\u00a0(or writing any other extra Java\ncode), which is designed to support simple sticky partitioning out of\nthe box for operators with logic agnostic to the partitioning scheme\nthat can be enabled by means of DAG construction alone.\n\n\nTypically an operator that can work with the default partitioning\nscheme would have a single input port. If there are multiple input\nports, only one port will be partitioned (the port first connected in\nthe DAG). The number of partitions will be calculated based on the\ninitial partition count - set as attribute on the operator in the DAG\n(if the attribute is not present, partitioning is off). Each partition\nwill handle tuples based on matching the lower bits of the hash code.\nFor example, if the tuple type was Integer and 2 partitions requested,\nall even numbers would go to one operator instance and all odd numbers\nto the other.\n\n\nDefault Dynamic Partitioning\n\n\nTriggering partition load evaluation and repartitioning action\nitself are separate concerns. Triggers are not specified further here,\nwe are planning to support it in a customizable fashion that, for\nexample, allows latency or SLA based implementations. Triggers calculate\na load indicator (signed number) that tells the framework that a given\npartition is either underutilized, operating normally within the\nexpected thresholds or overloaded and becoming a bottleneck. The\nindicator is then presented to the partitioning logic (default or custom\nimplementation of Partitioner) to provide the opportunity to make any\nneeded adjustments.\n\n\nThe default partitioning logic divides the key space\naccording to the lower bits of the hash codes that are generated by the\nstream codec, by assigning each partitioned operator instance via a bit\nmask and the respective value. For example, the operator may have\ninitially two partitions,  0 and 1, each\nwith a bit mask of 1.\nIn the case where load evaluation flags partition\n0  as over utilized\n(most data tuples processed yield a hash code with lowest bit cleared),\na partition split\u00a0occurs, resulting in 00\nand 10 with mask 11. Operator instance 0 will be replaced with 2 new instances and partition\n1  remains unchanged,\nresulting in three active partitions. The same process could repeat if\nmost tuples fall into the 01 partition, leading to a split into 001 and 101\nwith mask 111, etc.\n\n\nShould load decrease in two sibling partitions, a\npartition merge\u00a0could\nreverse the split, reducing the mask length and replacing two operators\nwith one. Should only one of two sibling partitions be underutilized,\n it cannot be\u00a0merged.\nInstead, the platform can attempt to deploy the affected operator\ninstance along with other operator instances for resource sharing\namongst underutilized partitions (not implemented yet). Keeping separate\noperator instances allows\u00a0us  to\npin load increases directly to the affected instance with a single\nspecific partition key, which would not be the case had we assigned a\nshared instance to handle multiple keys.\n\n\nNxM Partitions\n\n\nWhen two consecutive logical operators are partitioned a special\noptimization is done. Technically the output of the first operator\nshould be unified and streamed to the next logical node. But that can\ncreate a network bottleneck. The platform optimizes this by partitioning\nthe output stream of each partition of the first operator as per the\npartitions needed by the next operator. For example if the first\noperator has N partitions and the second operator has M partitions then\neach of the N partitions would send out M streams. The first of each of\nthese M streams would be unified and routed to the first of the M\npartitions, and so on. Such an optimization allows for higher\nscalability and eliminates a network bottleneck (one unifier in between\nthe two operators) by having M unifiers. This also enables the\napplication to perform within the resource limits enforced by YARN.\nSTRAM has a much better understanding and estimation of unifier resource\nneeds and is thus able to optimize for resource constraints.\n\n\nFigure 5 shows a case where we have a 3x2 partition; the single\nintermediate unifier between operator 1\u00a0and 2\u00a0is\noptimized away. The partition computation for operator  2\u00a0is executed on outbound streams of each\npartitions of operator 1. Each\npartition of operator 2\u00a0has its own\nCONTAINER_LOCAL unifier. In such a situation, the in-bound network\ntuple flow is split between containers for  2a\u00a0and 2b\u00a0each of which take half the traffic. STRAM\ndoes this by default since it always has better performance.\n\n\n\n\nParallel\n\n\nIn cases where all the downstream operators use the same\npartitioning scheme and the DAG is network bound an optimization called\nparallel partition\u00a0is very\neffective. In such a scenario all the downstream operators are also\npartitioned to create computation flow per partition. This optimization\nis extremely efficient for network bound streams, In some cases this\noptimization would also apply for CPU or RAM bounded\napplications.\n\n\nIn Figure 6a, operator 1\u00a0is\npartitioned into 1a\u00a0and\n1b. Both the downstream operators\n2\u00a0and  3\u00a0follow the same partition scheme as\n1, however the network I/O between\n1\u00a0and 2, and between 2\u00a0and  3\u00a0is\nhigh. Then users can decide to optimize using parallel partitions. This\nallows STRAM to completely skip the insertion of intermediate Unifier\noperators between 1 and 2 as well as between 2 and 3; a single unifier\njust before operator  4, is\nadequate by which time tuple flow volume is low.\n\n\nSince operator 4 has sufficient resources to manage the combined\noutput of multiple instances of operator 3, it need not be partitioned. A further\noptimization can be done by declaring operators  1, 2, and\n3\u00a0as THREAD_LOCAL (intra-thread)\nor CONTAINER_LOCAL (intra-process) or NODE_LOCAL (intra-node).\nParallel partition is not used by default, users have to specify it\nexplicitly via an attribute of the input port (reader) of the stream as\nshown below.\n\n\n\n\nThe following code shows an example of creating a parallel partition.\n\n\ndag.addStream(\nDenormalizedUserId\n, idAssigner.userid, uniqUserCount.data);\ndag.setInputPortAttribute(uniqUserCount.data, PortContext.PARTITION_PARALLEL, partitionParallel);\n\n\n\n\nParallel partitions can be used with other partitions, for example\na parallel partition could be sticky key or load balanced.\n\n\nParallel Partitions with Streams Modes\n\n\nParallel partitions can be further optimized if the parallel\npartitions are combined with streams being in-line or in-node or in-rack\nmode. This is very powerful feature and should be used if operators have\nvery high throughput within them and the outbound merge does an\naggregation. For example in Figure 6b, if operator 3 significantly\nreduces the throughput, which usually is a reason to do parallel\npartition, then making the streams in-line or in-node within nodes\n1-\n2 and 2-\n3 significantly impacts the performance.\n\n\nCONTAINER_LOCAL stream has high bandwidth, and can manage to\nconsume massive tuple count without taxing the NIC and networking stack.\nThe downside is that all operators (1,2,3) in this case need to be able\nto fit within the resource limits of CPU and memory enforced on a Hadoop\ncontainer. A way around this is to request RM to provide a big\ncontainer. On a highly used Hadoop grid, getting a bigger container may\nbe a problem, and operational complexities of managing a Hadoop cluster\nwith different container sizes may be higher. If THREAD_LOCAL or\nCONTAINER_LOCAL streams are needed to get the throughput, increasing\nthe partition count should be considered. In future STRAM may take this\ndecision automatically. Unless there is a very bad skew and sticky key\npartitioning is in use, the approach to partition till each container\nhas enough resources works well.\n\n\nA NODE_LOCAL stream has lower bandwidth compared to a\nCONTAINER_LOCAL stream, but it works well with the RM in terms of\nrespecting container size limits. A NODE_LOCAL parallel partition uses\nlocal loop back for streams and is much better than using NIC. Though\nNODE_LOCAL stream fits well with similar size containers, it does need\nRM to be able to deliver two containers on the same Hadoop node. On a\nheavily used Hadoop cluster, this may not always be possible. In future\nSTRAM would do these trade-offs automatically at run-time.\n\n\nA RACK_LOCAL stream has much lower bandwidth than NODE_LOCAL\nstream, as events go through the NIC. But it still is able to better\nmanage SLA and latency. Moreover RM has much better ability to give a\nrack local container as opposed to the other two.\n\n\nParallel partitions with CONTAINER_LOCAL streams can be done by\nsetting all the intermediate streams to CONTAINER_LOCAL. Parallel\npartitions with THREAD_LOCAL streams can be done by setting all the\nintermediate streams to THREAD_LOCAL. Platform supports the following\nvia attributes.\n\n\n\n\nParallel-Partition\n\n\nParallel-Partition with THREAD_LOCAL stream\n\n\nParallel-Partition with CONTAINER_LOCAL stream\n\n\nParallel-Partition with NODE_LOCAL stream\n\n\nParallel-Partition with RACK_LOCAL stream\n\n\n\n\nThese attributes would nevertheless be initial starting point and\nSTRAM can improve on them at run time.\n\n\n\n\nSkew Balancing Partition\n\n\nSkew balancing partition is useful to manage skews in the stream\nthat is load balanced using a sticky key. Incoming events may have a\nskew, and these may change depending on various factors like time of the\nday or other special circumstances. To manage the uneven load, users can\nset a limit on the ratio of maximum load on a partition to the minimum\nload on a partition. STRAM would use this to dynamically change the\npartitions. For example suppose there are 6 partitions, and the load\nhappens to be distributed as follows: one with 40%, and the rest with\n12% each. The ratio of maximum to minimum is 3.33. If the desired ratio\nis set to 2, STRAM would partition the first instance into two\npartitions, each with 20% load to bring the ratio down to the desired\nlevel. This will be tried repeatedly till partitions are balanced. The\ntime period between each attempt is controlled via an attribute to avoid\nrebalancing too frequently. As mentioned earlier, dynamic operations\ninclude both splitting a partition as well as merging partitions with\nlow load.\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of skew balancing partition. An example\nof 3x1 partition is shown. Let's say that skew balance is kept at \u201cno\npartition to take up more than 50% load. If in runtime the load type\nchanges to create a skew. For example, consider an application in the US\nthat is processing a website clickstream. At night in the US, the\nmajority of accesses come from the Far East, while in the daytime it\ncomes from the Americas. Similarly, in the early morning, the majority\nof the accesses are from east coast of the US, with the skew shifting to\nthe west coast as the day progresses. Assume operator 1 is partitioned\ninto 1a, 1b, and 1c.\n\n\nLet's see what happens if the logical operator 1 gets into a 20%,\n20%, 60% skew as shown in Figure 7. This would trigger the skew\nbalancing partition. One example of attaining balance is to merge 1a,\nand 1b to get 1a+1b in a single partition to take the load to 40%; then\nsplit 1c into two partitions 1ca and 1cb to get 30% on each of them.\nThis way STRAM is able to get back to under 50% per partition. As a live\n24x7 application, this kind of skew partitioning can be applied several\ntimes in a day. Skew-balancing at runtime is a critical feature for SLA\ncompliance; it also enables cost savings. This partitioning scheme will\nbe available in later release.\n\n\n\n\nSkew Unifier Partition\n\n\nIn this section we would take a look at another way to balance the\nskew. This method is a little less disruptive, but is useful in\naggregate operators. Let us take the same example as in Figure 7 with\nskew 20%, 20%, and 60%. To manage the load we could have either worked\non rebalancing the partition, which involves a merge and split of\npartitions to get to a new distribution or by partitioning  only\u00a0the partition with the big skew. Since the\nbest way to manage skew is to load balance, if possible, this scheme\nattempts to do so. The method is less useful than the others we discusse\n-- the main reason being that if the developer has chosen a sticky key\npartition to start with, it is unlikely that a load balancing scheme can\nhelp. Assuming that it is worthwhile to load balance, a special\none-purpose unifier can be inserted for the skew partition. If the cause\nof resource bottleneck is not the I/O, specially the I/O into the\ndownstream operator, but is the compute (memory, CPU) power of a\npartition, it makes sense to split the skew partition without having to\nchange the in-bound I/O to the upstream operator.\n\n\nTo trigger this users can set a limit on the ratio of maximum load\non a partition to the minimum load on a partition, and ask to use this\nscheme. STRAM would use this to load balance.The time period between\neach attempt is controlled via the same attribute to avoid rebalancing\ntoo frequently.\n\n\nFigure 8 shows an example of skew load balancing partition with a\ndedicated unifier. The 20%, 20%, and 60% triggers the skew load\nbalancing partition with an unifier. Partition 1c would be split into\ntwo and it would get its own dedicated unifier. Ideally these two\nadditional partitions 1ca and 1cb will get 30% load. This way STRAM is\nable to get back to under 50% per partition. This scheme is very useful\nwhen the number of partitions is very high and we still have a bad\nskew.\n\n\nIn the steady state no physical partition is computing more than\n30% of the load. Memory and CPU resources are thus well distributed. The\nunifier that was inserted has to handle 60% of the load, distributed\nmore evenly, as opposed to the final unifier that had a 60% skew to\nmanage at a much higher total load. This partitioning scheme will be\navailable in later release.\n\n\n\n\nCascading Unifier\n\n\nLet's take the case of an upstream operator oprU\u00a0that connects to a downstream operator\noprD. Let's assume the application\nis set to scale oprU by load balancing. So this could be either Nx1 or\nNxM partitioning scheme. The upstream operator oprU scales by increasing\nN. An increase in the load triggers more resource needs (CPU, Memory, or\nI/O), which in turn triggers more containers and raises N, the\ndownstream node may be impacted in a lot of situations. In this section\nwe review a method to shield oprD from dynamic changes in the execution\nplan of oprU. On aggregate operators (Sum, Count, Max, Min, Range \u2026) it\nis better to do load balanced partitioning to avoid impact of skew. This\nworks very well as each partition emits tuples at the order of number of\nkeys (range) in the incoming stream per application window. But as N\ngrows the in-bound I/O to the unifier of oprU that runs in the container\nof oprD goes up proportionately as each upstream partition sends tuples\nof the order of unique keys (range). This means that the partitioning\nwould not scale linearly. The platform has mechanisms to manage this and\nget the scale back to being linear.\n\n\nCascading unifiers are implemented by inserting a series of\nintermediate unifiers before the final unifier in the container of oprD.\nSince each unifier guarantees that the outbound I/O would be in order of\nthe number of unique keys, the unifier in the oprD container can expect\nto achieve an upper limit on the inbound I/O. The problem is the same\nirrespective of the value of M (1 or more), wherein the amount of\ninbound I/O is proportional to N, not M. Figure 8 illustrates how\ncascading unifier works.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows an example where a 4x1 partition with single\nunifier is split into three 2x1 partitions to enable the final unifier\nin oprD container to get an upper limit on inbound I/O. This is useful\nto ensure that network I/O to containers is within limits, or within a\nlimit specified by users. The platform allows setting an upper limit of\nfan-in of the stream between oprU and oprD. Let's say that this is F (in\nthe figure F=2). STRAM would plan N/F (let's call it N1) containers,\neach with one unifier. The inbound fan-in to these unifiers is F. If N1\n\n F, another level of unifiers would be inserted. Let's say at some\npoint N/(F1*F2*...Fk) \n F, where K is the level of unifiers. The\noutbound I/O of each unifier is guaranteed to be under F, specially the\nunifier for oprD. This ensures that the application scales linearly as\nthe load grows. The downside is the additional latency imposed by each\nunifier level (a few milliseconds), but the SLA is maintained, and the\napplication is able to run within the resource limits imposed by YARN.\nThe value of F can be derived from any of the following\n\n\n\n\nI/O limit on containers to allow proper behavior in an\n    multi-tenant environment\n\n\nLoad on oprD instance\n\n\nBuffer server limits on fan-in, fan-out\n\n\nSize of reservoir buffer for inbound fan-in\n\n\n\n\nA more intriguing optimization comes when cascading unifiers are\ncombined with node-local execution plan, in which the bounds of two or\nmore containers are used and much higher local loopback limits are\nleveraged. In general the first level fan-in limit (F1) and the last\nstage fan-in limit (Fk) need not be same. In fact a much open and better\nleveraged execution plan may indeed have F1 != F2 != \u2026 != Fk, as Fk\ndetermines the fan-in for oprD, while F1, \u2026 Fk-1 are fan-ins for\nunifier-only containers. The platform will have these schemes in later\nversions.\n\n\nSLA\n\n\nA Service Level Agreement translates to guaranteeing that the\napplication would meet the requirements X% of the time. For example six\nsigma X is\u00a099.99966%. For\nreal-time streaming applications this translates to requirements for\nlatency, throughput, uptime, data loss etc. and that in turn indirectly\nleads to various resource requirements, recovery mechanisms, etc. The\nplatform is designed to handle these and features would be released in\nfuture as they get developed. At a top level, STRAM monitors throughput\nper operator, computes latency per operator, manages uptime and supports\nvarious recovery mechanisms to handle data loss. A lot of this decision\nmaking and algorithms will be customizable.\n\n\n\n\nFault Tolerance\n\n\nFault tolerance in the platform is defined as the ability to\nrecognize the outage of any part of the application, get resources,\nre-initialize the failed operators, and re-compute the lost data. The\ndefault method is to bring the affected part of the DAG \u00a0back to a known\n(checkpointed) state and recompute atomic micro batches from there on.\nThus the default is  at least\nonce\u00a0processing mode. An operator can be configured for\nat most once\u00a0recovery, in which\ncase the re-initialized operator starts from next available window; or\nfor exactly once\u00a0recovery, in which\ncase the operator only recomputes the window it was processing when the\noutage happened.\n\n\nState of the Application\n\n\nThe state of the application is traditionally defined as the state\nof all operators and streams at any given time. Monitoring state as\nevery tuple is processed asynchronously in a distributed environment\nbecomes a near impossible task, and cost paid to achieve it is very\nhigh. Consequently, in the platform, state is not saved per tuple, but\nrather at window boundaries. The platform treats windows as atomic micro\nbatches. The state saving task is delegated by STRAM to the individual\noperator or container. This ensures that the bookkeeping cost is very\nlow and works in a distributed way. Thus, the state of the application\nis defined as the collection of states of every operator and the set of\nall windows stored in the buffer server. This allows STRAM to rebuild\nany part of the application from the last saved state of the impacted\noperators and the windows retained by the buffer server. The state of an\noperator is intrinsically associated with a window id. Since operators\ncan override the default checkpointing period, operators may save state\nat the end of different windows. This works because the buffer server\nsaves all windows for as long as they are needed (state in the buffer\nserver is purged once STRAM determines that it is not longer needed\nbased on checkpointing in downstream operators).\n\n\nOperators can be stateless or stateful. A stateless operator\nretains no data between windows. All results of all computations done in\na window are emitted in that window. Variables in such an operator are\neither transient or are cleared by an end_window event. Such operators\nneed no state restoration after an outage. A stateful operator retains\ndata between windows and has data in checkpointed state. This data\n(state) is used for computation in future windows. Such an operator\nneeds its state restored after an outage. By default the platform\nassumes the operator is stateful. In order to optimize recovery (skip\nprocessing related to state recovery) for a stateless operator, the\noperator needs to be declared as stateless to STRAM. Operators can\nexplicitly mark themselves stateless via an annotation or an\nattribute.\n\n\nRecovery mechanisms are explained later in this section. Operator\ndevelopers have to ensure that there is no dependency on the order of\ntuples between two different streams. As mentioned earlier in this\ndocument, the platform guarantees in-order tuple delivery within a\nsingle stream, For operators with multiple input ports, a replay may\nresult in a different relative order of tuples among the different input\nports. If the output tuple computation is affected by this relative\norder, the operator may have to wait for the endWindow call (at which\npoint it would have seen all the tuples from all input ports in the\ncurrent window), perform order-dependent computations correctly and\nfinally, emit results.\n\n\nCheckpointing\n\n\nSTRAM provides checkpointing parameters to StreamingContainer\nduring initialization. A checkpoint period is given to the containers\nthat have the window generators. A control tuple is sent at the end of\ncheckpoint interval. This tuple traverses through the data path via\nstreams and triggers each StreamingContainer in the path to instrument a\ncheckpoint of the operator that receives this tuple. This ensures that\nall the operators checkpoint at exactly the same window boundary (except\nin those cases where a different checkpoint interval was configured for\nan operator by the user).\n\n\nThe only delay is the latency of the control tuple to reach all\nthe operators. Checkpoint is thus done between the endWindow call of a\nwindow and the beginWindow call of the next window. Since most operators\nare computing in parallel (with the exception of those connected by\nTHREAD_LOCAL streams) they each checkpoint as and when they are ready\nto process the \u201ccheckpoint\u201d control tuple. The asynchronous design of\nthe platform means that there is no guarantee that two operators would\ncheckpoint at exactly the same time, but there is a guarantee that by\ndefault they would checkpoint at the same window boundary. This feature\nalso ensures that purge of old data can be efficiently done: Once the\ncheckpoint window tuple is done traversing the DAG, the checkpoint state\nof the entire DAG increments to this window id at which point prior\ncheckpoint data can be discarded.\n\n\nIn case of an operator that has an application window size that is\nlarger than the size of the streaming window, the checkpointing by\ndefault still happens at same intervals as with other operators. To\nalign checkpointing with application window boundary, the application\ndeveloper should set the attribute \u201cCHECKPOINT_WINDOW_COUNT\u201d to\n\u201cAPPLICATION_WINDOW_COUNT\u201d. This ensures that the checkpoint happens\nat the  end\u00a0of the application\nwindow and not within\u00a0that window.\nSuch operators now treat the application window as an atomic computation\nunit. The downside is that it does need the upstream buffer server to\nkeep tuples for the entire application window.\n\n\nIf an operator is completely stateless, i.e. an outbound tuple is\nonly emitted in the process\u00a0call\nand only depends on the tuple of that call, there is no need to align\ncheckpointing with application window end. If the operator is stateful\nonly within a window, the operator developer should strongly consider\ncheckpointing only on the application window boundary.\n\n\nCheckpointing involves pausing an operator, serializing the state\nto persistent storage and then resuming the operator. Thus checkpointing\nhas a latency cost that can negatively affect computational throughput;\nto minimize that impact, it is important to ensure that checkpointing is\ndone with minimal required objects. This means, as mentioned earlier,\nall data that is not part of the operator state should be declared as\ntransient so that it is not persisted.\n\n\nAn operator developer can also create a stateless operator (marked\nwith the Stateless annotation). Stateless operators are not\ncheckpointed. Obviously, in such an operator, computation should not\ndepend on state from a previous window.\n\n\nThe serialized \u00a0state of an operator is stored as a file, and is\nthe state to which that the operator is restored if an outage happens\nbefore the next checkpoint. The id of the last completed window (per\noperator) is sent back to STRAM in the next heartbeat. The default\nimplementation for serialization uses KRYO. Multiple past checkpoints\nare kept per operator. Depending on the downstream checkpoint, one of\nthese are chosen for recovery. Checkpoints and buffer server state are\npurged once STRAM sees windows as fully processed in the DAG.\n\n\nA complete recovery of an operator needs the operator to be\ncreated, its checkpointed state restored and then all the lost atomic\nwindows replayed by the upstream buffer server(s). The above design\nkeeps the bookkeeping cost low with quick catch up time. In the next\nsection we will see how this simple abstraction allows applications to\nrecover under different requirements.\n\n\nRecovery Mechanisms\n\n\nRecovery mechanism are ways to recover from a container (or an\noperator) outage. In this section we discuss a single container outage.\nMultiple container outages are handled as independent events. Recovery\nrequires the upstream buffer server to replay windows and it would\nsimply go one more level upstream if the immediate upstream container\nhas also failed. If multiple operators are in a container (THREAD_LOCAL\nor CONTAINER_LOCAL stream) the container recovery treats each operator\nas an independent object when figuring out the recovery steps.\nApplication developers can set any of the recovery mechanisms discussed\nbelow for node outage.\n\n\nIn general, the cost of recovery depends on the state of the\noperator and the recovery mechanism selected, while data loss tolerance\nis specified by the application. For example a data-loss tolerant\napplication would prefer at most\nonce\u00a0recovery. All recovery mechanisms treat a streaming\nwindow as an atomic computation unit. In all three recovery mechanisms\nthe new operator connects to the upstream buffer server and asks for\ndata from a particular window onwards. Thus all recovery methods\ntranslate to deciding which atomic units to re-compute and which state\nthe new operator resumes from. A partially computed micro-batch is\nalways dropped. Such micro-batches are re-computed in at-least-once or\nexactly-once mode and skipped in at-most-once mode. The notion of an\natomic micro-batch is a critical guiding principle as it enables very\nlow bookkeeping costs, high throughput, low recovery times, and high\nscalability. Within an application each operator can have its own\nrecovery mechanism.\n\n\nAt Least Once\n\n\nAt least once recovery is the default recovery mechanism, i.e it\nis used when no mechanism is specified. In this method, the lost\noperator is brought back to its latest viable checkpointed state and the\nupstream buffer server is asked to replay all subsequent windows. There\nis no data loss in recovery. The viable checkpoint state is defined as\nthe one whose window id is in the past as compared to all the\ncheckpoints of all the downstream operators. All downstream operators\nare restarted at their checkpointed state. They ignore all incoming data\nthat belongs to windows prior their checkpointed window. The lost\nwindows are thus recomputed and the application catches up with live\nincoming data. This is called \" at least\nonce\"\u00a0because lost windows are recomputed. For example if\nthe streaming window is 0.5 seconds and checkpointing is being done\nevery 30 seconds, then upon node outage all windows since the last\ncheckpoint (up to 60 windows) need to be re-processed. If the\napplication can handle loss of data, then this is not the most optimal\nrecovery mechanism.\n\n\nIn general for this recovery mode, the average time lag on a node\noutage is\n\n\n= (CP/2*SW)*T + HC\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\nCP\n\u00a0\u00a0- Checkpointing period (default value is 30 seconds)\n\n\nSW\n\u00a0\u00a0- Streaming window period (default value is 0.5 seconds)\n\n\nT\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0Time taken to re-compute one lost window from data in memory\n\n\nHC\n\u00a0\u00a0- Time it takes to get a new Hadoop Container, or make do with the current ones\n\n\n\n\nA lower CP is a trade off between cost of checkpointing and the\nneed to have to use it in case of outage. Input adapters cannot use\nat-least-once recovery without the support from sources outside Hadoop.\nFor an output adapter care may needed if the external system cannot\nhandle re-write of the same data.\n\n\nAt Most Once\n\n\nThis recovery mechanism is for applications that can tolerate\ndata-loss; they get the quickest recovery in return. The restarted node\nconnects to the upstream buffer server, subscribing to data from the\nstart of the next window. It then starts processing that window. The\ndownstream operators ignore the lost windows and continue to process\nincoming data normally. Thus, this mechanism forces all downstream\noperators to follow.\n\n\nFor multiple inputs, the operator waits for all ports with the\nat-most-once attribute to get responses from their respective buffer\nservers. Then, the operator starts processing till the end window of the\nlatest window id on each input port is reached. In this case the end\nwindow tuple is non-blocking till the common window id is reached. At\nthis point the input ports are now properly synchronized. Upstream nodes\nreconnect under  at most\nonce\u00a0paradigm in same way. \u00a0For example, assume an operator\nhas ports in1\u00a0and in2\u00a0and a checkpointed window of 95. Assume further that the buffer servers of\noperators upstream of  in1\u00a0and\nin2\u00a0respond with window id 100 and\n102 respectively. Then port in1\u00a0would continue to process till end window of\n101, while port  in2\u00a0will wait for in1\nto catch up to 102.\nFrom \u00a0then on, both ports process their tuples normally. So windows from\n96 to  99are lost. Window 100\nand 101 has only\nin1 active, and 102 onwards both ports are active. The other\nports of upstream nodes would also catch up till  102in a similar fashion. This operator may not\nneed to be checkpointed. Currently the option to not do checkpoint in\nsuch cases is not available.\n\n\nIn general, in this recovery mode, the average time lag on a node\noutage is\n\n\n= SW/2 + HC\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSW\n\u00a0- Streaming window period (default value is 0.5\nseconds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHC\n\u00a0- Time it takes to get a new Hadoop Container, or make\ndo with the current ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExactly Once\n\n\nThis recovery mechanism is for applications that require no\ndata-loss as well are no recomputation. Since a window is an atomic\ncompute unit, exactly once applies to the window as a whole. In this\nrecovery mode, the operator is brought back to the start of the window\nin which the outage happened and the window is recomputed. The window is\nconsidered closed when all the data computations are done and end window\ntuple is emitted. \u00a0Exactly once requires every window to be\ncheckpointed. From then on, the operator asks the upstream buffer server\nto send data from the last checkpoint. The upstream node behaves the\nsame as in at-most-once recovery. Checkpointing after every streaming\nwindow is very costly, but users would most often do exactly once per\napplication window; if the application window size is substantially\nlarger than the streaming window size (which typically is the case) the\ncost of running an operator in this recovery mode may not be as\nhigh.\n\n\nSpeculative Execution\n\n\nIn future we looking at possibility of adding speculative execution for the applications. This would be enabled in multiple ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt an operator level: The upstream operator would emit to\n    two copies. The downstream operator would receive from both copies\n    and pick a winner. The winner (primary) would be picked in either of\n    the following ways\n\n\n\n\nStatically as dictated by STRAM\n\n\nDynamically based on whose tuple arrives first. This mode\n    needs both copies to guarantee that the computation result would\n    have identical functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a sub-query level: A part of the application DAG would be\n    run in parallel and all upstream operators would feed to two copies\n    and all downstream operators would receive from both copies. The\n    winners would again be picked in a static or dynamic manner\n\n\n\n\nEntire DAG: Another copy of the application would be run by\n    STRAM and the winner would be decided outside the application. In\n    this mode the output adapters would both be writing\n    the result.\n\n\n\n\nIn all cases the two copies would run on different Hadoop nodes.\nSpeculative execution is under development and\nis not yet available.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Application Modifications\n\n\nDynamic application modifications are being worked on and most of\nthe features discussed here are now available. The platform supports the\nability to modify the DAG of the application as per inputs as well as\nset constraints, and will continue to provide abilities to deepen\nfeatures based on this ability. All these changes have one thing in\ncommon and that is the application does not need to be restarted as\nSTRAM will instrument the changes and the streaming will catch-up and\ncontinue.\n\n\nSome examples are\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Partitioning:\u00a0Automatic\n    changes in partitioning of computations to match constraints on a\n    run time basis. Examples includes STRAM adding resource during spike\n    in streams and returning them once spike is gone. Scale up and scale\n    down is done automatically without human intervention.\n\n\nModification via constraints: Attributes can be changed via\n    Webservices and STRAM would adapt the execution plan to meet these.\n    Examples include operations folks asking STRAM to reduce container\n    count, or changing network resource restrictions.\n\n\nModification via properties: Properties of operators can be\n    changed in run time. This enables application developers to trigger\n    a new behavior as need be. Examples include triggering an alert ON.\n    The platform supports changes to any property of an operator that\n    has a setter function defined.\n\n\nModification of DAG structure: Operators and streams can be\n    added to or removed from a running DAG, provided the code of the\n    operator being added is already in the classpath of the running\n    application master. \u00a0This enables application developers to add or\n    remove processing pipelines on the fly without having to restart\n    the application.\n\n\nQuery Insertion: Addition of sub-queries to currently\n    running application. This query would take current streams as inputs\n    and start computations as per their specs. Examples insertion of\n    SQL-queries on live data streams, dynamic query submission and\n    result from STRAM (not yet available).\n\n\n\n\nDynamic modifications to applications are foundational part of the\nplatform. They enable users to build layers over the applications. Users\ncan also save all the changes done since the application launch, and\ntherefore predictably get the application to its current state. For\ndetails refer to  \nConfiguration Guide\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nUser Interface\n\n\nThe platform provides a rich user interface. This includes tools\nto monitor the application system metrics (throughput, latency, resource\nutilization, etc.); dashboards for application data, replay, errors; and\na Developer studio for application creation, launch etc. For details\nrefer to  \nUI Console Guide\n.\n\n\nDemos\n\n\nIn this section we list some of the demos that come packaged with\ninstaller. The source code for the demos is available in the open-source\n\nApache Apex-Malhar repository\n.\nAll of these do computations in real-time. Developers are encouraged to\nreview them as they use various features of the platform and provide an\nopportunity for quick learning.\n\n\n\n\nComputation of PI:\n    Computes PI by generating a random location on X-Y plane and\n    measuring how often it lies within the unit circle centered\n    at (0,0).\n\n\nYahoo! Finance quote\u00a0computation:\n    Computes ticker quote, 1-day chart (per min), and simple moving\n    averages (per 5 min).\n\n\nEchoserver Reads messages from a\n    network connection and echoes them back out.\n\n\nTwitter top N tweeted urls: Computes\n    top N tweeted urls over last 5 minutes\n\n\nTwitter trending hashtags: Computes\n    the top Twitter Hashtags over the last 5 minutes\n\n\nTwitter top N frequent words:\n    Computes top N frequent words in a sliding window\n\n\nWord count: Computes word count for\n    all words within a large file\n\n\nMobile location tracker: Tracks\n    100,000 cell phones within an area code moving at car speed (jumping\n    cell phone towers every 1-5 seconds).\n\n\nFrauddetect: Analyzes a stream of\n    credit card merchant transactions.\n\n\nMroperator:Contains several\n    map-reduce applications.\n\n\nR: Analyzes a synthetic stream of\n    eruption event data for the Old Faithful\n    geyser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful).\n\n\nMachinedata: Analyzes a synthetic\n    stream of events to determine health of a machine.",

            "text": "Real-time big data processing is not only important but has become\ncritical for businesses which depend on accurate and timely analysis of\ntheir business data. A few businesses have yielded to very expensive\nsolutions like building an in-house, real-time analytics infrastructure\nsupported by an internal development team, or buying expensive\nproprietary software. A large number of businesses are dealing with the\nrequirement just by trying to make Hadoop do their batch jobs in smaller\niterations. Over the last few years, Hadoop has become ubiquitous in the\nbig data processing space, replacing expensive proprietary hardware and\nsoftware solutions for massive data processing with very cost-effective,\nfault-tolerant, open-sourced, and commodity-hardware-based solutions.\nWhile Hadoop has been a game changer for companies, it is primarily a\nbatch-oriented system, and does not yet have a viable option for\nreal-time data processing. \u00a0Most companies with real-time data\nprocessing end up having to build customized solutions in addition to\ntheir Hadoop infrastructure.  The DataTorrent platform is designed to process massive amounts of\nreal-time events natively in Hadoop. This can be event ingestion,\nprocessing, and aggregation for real-time data analytics, or can be\nreal-time business logic decisioning such as cell tower load balancing,\nreal-time ads bidding, or fraud detection. \u00a0The platform has the ability\nto repair itself in real-time (without data loss) if hardware fails, and\nadapt to changes in load by adding and removing computing resources\nautomatically.  DataTorrent is a native Hadoop application. It runs as a YARN\n(Hadoop 2.x) application and leverages Hadoop as a distributed operating\nsystem. All the basic distributed operating system capabilities of\nHadoop like resource allocation (Resource Manager, distributed file system (HDFS),\nmulti-tenancy, security, fault-tolerance, scalability,\u00a0etc.\nare supported natively in all streaming applications. \u00a0Just as Hadoop\nfor map-reduce handles all the details of the application allowing you\nto only focus on writing the application (the mapper and reducer\nfunctions), the platform handles all the details of streaming execution,\nallowing you to only focus on your business logic. Using the platform\nremoves the need to maintain separate clusters for real-time\napplications.  In the platform, building a streaming application can be extremely\neasy and intuitive. \u00a0The application is represented as a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) of computation units called  Operators  interconnected\nby the data-flow edges called   Streams .\u00a0The operators process input\nstreams and produce output streams. A library of common operators is\nprovided to enable quick application development. \u00a0In case the desired\nprocessing is not available in the Operator Library, one can easily\nwrite a custom operator. We refer those interested in creating their own\noperators to the  Operator Development Guide .",

The first operator\nemits random integers between 0 to 30, 000. The second operator receives\nthese coefficients and emits a hashmap with x and y values each time it\nreceives two values. The third operator takes these values and computes\nx**2+y**2. The last operator counts how many computed values from\nthe previous operator were less than or equal to 30, 000**2. Assuming\nthis count is N, then PI is computed as N/number of values received.\nHere is the code snippet for the PI application. This code populates the\nDAG.

            "text": "The PI\u00a0application was to\nget you started. It is a basic application and does not fully illustrate\nthe features of the platform. For the purpose of describing concepts, we\nwill consider the test application shown in Figure 1. The application\ndownloads tick data from   Yahoo! Finance  \u00a0and computes the\nfollowing for four tickers, namely  IBM , GOOG ,  YHOO .   Quote: Consisting of last trade price, last trade time, and\n    total volume for the day  Per-minute chart data: Highest trade price, lowest trade\n    price, and volume during that minute  Simple Moving Average: trade price over 5 minutes   Total volume must ensure that all trade volume for that day is\nadded, i.e. data loss would result in wrong results. Charting data needs\nall the trades in the same minute to go to the same slot, and then on it\nstarts afresh, so again data loss would result in wrong results. The\naggregation for charting data is done over 1 minute. Simple moving\naverage computes the average price over a 5 minute sliding window; it\ntoo would produce wrong results if there is data loss. Figure 1 shows\nthe application with no partitioning.   The operator StockTickerInput:\u00a0StockTickerInput \u00a0 is\nthe input operator that reads live data from Yahoo! Finance once per\ninterval (user configurable in milliseconds), and emits the price, the\nincremental volume, and the last trade time of each stock symbol, thus\nemulating real ticks from the exchange. \u00a0We utilize the Yahoo! Finance\nCSV web service interface. \u00a0For example:  $ GET 'http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=IBM,GOOG,AAPL,YHOO f=sl1vt1' IBM ,203.966,1513041, 1:43pm  GOOG ,762.68,1879741, 1:43pm  AAPL ,444.3385,11738366, 1:43pm  YHOO ,19.3681,14707163, 1:43pm   Among all the operators in Figure 1, StockTickerInput is the only\noperator that requires extra code because it contains a custom mechanism\nto get the input data. \u00a0Other operators are used unchanged from the\nMalhar library.

Important: Since operators will be\nserialized, all input and output ports need to be declared transient\nbecause they are stateless and should not be serialized.  The method\u00a0setup(OperatorContext)\ncontains the code that is necessary for setting up the HTTP\nclient for querying Yahoo! Finance.  Method\u00a0emitTuples() contains\nthe code that reads from Yahoo! Finance, and emits the data to the\noutput ports of the operator. \u00a0emitTuples()\u00a0will be called one or more times\nwithin one application window as long as time is allowed within the\nwindow.  Note that we want to emulate the tick input stream by having\nincremental volume data with Yahoo! Finance data. \u00a0We therefore subtract\nthe previous volume from the current volume to emulate incremental\nvolume for each tick.  The operator\nDailyVolume:\u00a0This operator\nreads from the input port, which contains the incremental volume tuples\nfrom StockTickInput, and\naggregates the data to provide the cumulative volume. \u00a0It uses the\nlibrary class  SumKeyVal K,V \u00a0provided in math\u00a0package. \u00a0In this case,\nSumKeyVal String,Long , where K is the stock symbol, V is the\naggregated volume, with cumulative\nset to true. (Otherwise if cumulative was set to false, SumKeyVal would\nprovide the sum for the application window.) \u00a0Malhar provides a number\nof built-in operators for simple operations like this so that\napplication developers do not have to write them. \u00a0More examples to\nfollow. This operator assumes that the application restarts before the\nmarket opens every day.  The operator Quote:\nThis operator has three input ports, which are price (from\nStockTickInput), daily_vol (from\nDaily Volume), and time (from\n StockTickInput). \u00a0This operator\njust consolidates the three data items and and emits the consolidated\ndata. \u00a0It utilizes the class ConsolidatorKeyVal K \u00a0from the\nstream\u00a0package.  The operator HighLow:\u00a0This operator reads from the input port,\nwhich contains the price tuples from StockTickInput, and provides the high and the\nlow price within the application window. \u00a0It utilizes the library class\n RangeKeyVal K,V \u00a0provided\nin the math\u00a0package. In this case,\nRangeKeyVal String,Double .  The operator MinuteVolume:\nThis operator reads from the input port, which contains the\nvolume tuples from StockTickInput,\nand aggregates the data to provide the sum of the volume within one\nminute. \u00a0Like the operator  DailyVolume, this operator also uses\nSumKeyVal String,Long , but\nwith cumulative set to false. \u00a0The\nApplication Window is set to one minute. We will explain how to set this\nlater.  The operator Chart:\nThis operator is very similar to the operator Quote, except that it takes inputs from\nHigh Low\u00a0and  Minute Vol\u00a0and outputs the consolidated tuples\nto the output port.  The operator PriceSMA:\nSMA stands for - Simple Moving Average. It reads from the\ninput port, which contains the price tuples from StockTickInput, and\nprovides the moving average price of the stock. \u00a0It utilizes\nSimpleMovingAverage String,Double , which is provided in the\n multiwindow\u00a0package.\nSimpleMovingAverage keeps track of the data of the previous N\napplication windows in a sliding manner. \u00a0For each end window event, it\nprovides the average of the data in those application windows.  The operator Console:\nThis operator just outputs the input tuples to the console\n(or stdout). \u00a0In this example, there are four console\u00a0operators, which connect to the output\nof  Quote, Chart, PriceSMA and VolumeSMA. \u00a0In\npractice, they should be replaced by operators that use the data to\nproduce visualization artifacts like charts.  Connecting the operators together and constructing the\nDAG:\u00a0Now that we know the\noperators used, we will create the DAG, set the streaming window size,\ninstantiate the operators, and connect the operators together by adding\nstreams that connect the output ports with the input ports among those\noperators. \u00a0This code is in the file  YahooFinanceApplication.java. Refer to Figure 1\nagain for the graphical representation of the DAG. \u00a0The last method in\nthe code, namely getApplication(),\ndoes all that. \u00a0The rest of the methods are just for setting up the\noperators.  package com.datatorrent.demos.yahoofinance;\n\nimport com.datatorrent.api.ApplicationFactory;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.Context.OperatorContext;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.DAG;\nimport com.datatorrent.api.Operator.InputPort;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.io.ConsoleOutputOperator;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.math.RangeKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.math.SumKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.multiwindow.SimpleMovingAverage;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.stream.ConsolidatorKeyVal;\nimport com.datatorrent.lib.util.HighLow;\nimport org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;\n\n/**\n * Yahoo!

The platform is designed to enable completely asynchronous real time computations\u00a0done in as unblocked a way as possible with\nminimal overhead .  Applications running in the platform are represented by a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) made up of \u00a0operators and streams. All computations\nare done in memory on arrival of\nthe input data, with an option to save the output to disk (HDFS) in a\nnon-blocking way. The data that flows between operators consists of\natomic data elements. Each data element along with its type definition\n(henceforth called  schema) is\ncalled a tuple.\u00a0An application is a\ndesign of the flow of these tuples to and from\nthe appropriate compute units to enable the computation of the final\ndesired results.\u00a0A message queue (henceforth called\n\u00a0buffer server) manages tuples streaming\nbetween compute units in different processes.This server keeps track of\nall consumers, publishers, partitions, and enables replay. More\ninformation is given in later section.  The streaming application is monitored by a decision making entity\ncalled STRAM (streaming application\nmanager).\u00a0STRAM is designed to be a light weight\ncontroller that has minimal but sufficient interaction with the\napplication. This is done via periodic heartbeats. The\nSTRAM does the initial launch and periodically analyzes the system\nmetrics to decide if any run time action needs to be taken.  A fundamental building block for the streaming platform\nis the concept of breaking up a stream into equal finite time slices\ncalled streaming windows. Each window contains the ordered\nset of tuples in that time slice. A typical duration of a window is 500\nms, but can be configured per application (the Yahoo! Finance\napplication configures this value in the  properties.xml\u00a0file to be 1000ms = 1s). Each\nwindow is preceded by a begin_window\u00a0event and is terminated by an\nend_window\u00a0event, and is assigned\na unique window ID. Even though the platform performs computations at\nthe tuple level, bookkeeping is done at the window boundary, making the\ncomputations within a window an atomic event in the platform. \u00a0We can\nthink of each window as an  atomic\nmicro-batch\u00a0of tuples, to be processed together as one\natomic operation (See Figure 2). \u00a0  This atomic batching allows the platform to avoid the very steep\nper tuple bookkeeping cost and instead has a manageable per batch\nbookkeeping cost. This translates to higher throughput, low recovery\ntime, and higher scalability. Later in this document we illustrate how\nthe atomic micro-batch concept allows more efficient optimization\nalgorithms.  The platform also has in-built support for\napplication windows.\u00a0 An application window is part of the\napplication specification, and can be a small or large multiple of the\nstreaming window. \u00a0An example from our Yahoo! Finance test application\nis the moving average, calculated over a sliding application window of 5\nminutes which equates to 300 (= 5 * 60) streaming windows.  Note that these two window concepts are distinct. \u00a0A streaming\nwindow is an abstraction of many tuples into a higher atomic event for\neasier management. \u00a0An application window is a group of consecutive\nstreaming windows used for data aggregation (e.g. sum, average, maximum,\nminimum) on a per operator level.   Alongside the platform,\u00a0a set of\npredefined, benchmarked standard library operator templates is provided\nfor ease of use and rapid development of application.\u00a0These\noperators are open sourced to Apache Software Foundation under the\nproject name \u201cMalhar\u201d as part of our efforts to foster community\ninnovation. These operators can be used in a DAG as is, while others\nhave   properties  \u00a0 that can be set to specify the\ndesired computation. Those interested in details, should refer to Apex Malhar Operator Library \n.  The platform is a Hadoop YARN native\napplication. It runs in a Hadoop cluster just like any\nother YARN application (MapReduce etc.) and is designed to seamlessly\nintegrate with rest of Hadoop technology stack. It leverages Hadoop as\nmuch as possible and relies on it as its distributed operating system.\nHadoop dependencies include resource management, compute/memory/network\nallocation, HDFS, security, fault tolerance, monitoring, metrics,\nmulti-tenancy, logging etc. Hadoop classes/concepts are reused as much\nas possible.  The aim is to enable enterprises\nto leverage their existing Hadoop infrastructure for real time streaming\napplications. The platform is designed to scale with big\ndata applications and scale with Hadoop.  A streaming application is an asynchronous execution of\ncomputations across distributed nodes. All computations are done in\nparallel on a distributed cluster. The computation model is designed to\ndo as many parallel computations as possible in a non-blocking fashion.\nThe task of monitoring of the entire application is done on (streaming)\nwindow boundaries with a streaming window as an atomic entity. A window\ncompletion is a quantum of work done. There is no assumption that an\noperator can be interrupted at precisely a particular tuple or window.  An operator itself also\ncannot assume or predict the exact time a tuple that it emitted would\nget consumed by downstream operators. The operator processes the tuples\nit gets and simply emits new tuples based on its business logic. The\nonly guarantee it has is that the upstream operators are processing\neither the current or some later window, and the downstream operator is\nprocessing either the current or some earlier window. The completion of\na window (i.e. propagation of the  end_window\u00a0event through an operator) in any\noperator guarantees that all upstream operators have finished processing\nthis window. Thus, the end_window\u00a0event is blocking on an operator\nwith multiple outputs, and is a synchronization point in the DAG. The\n begin_window\u00a0event does not have\nany such restriction, a single begin_window\u00a0event from any upstream operator\ntriggers the operator to start processing tuples.",

As an application developer you need to connect operators\nin a way that it implements your business logic. You may also require\noperator customization for functionality and use attributes for\nperformance/scalability etc.  All operators process tuples asynchronously in a distributed\ncluster. An operator cannot assume or predict the exact time a tuple\nthat it emitted will get consumed by a downstream operator. An operator\nalso cannot predict the exact time when a tuple arrives from an upstream\noperator. The only guarantee is that the upstream operators are\nprocessing the current or a future window, i.e. the windowId of upstream\noperator is equals or exceeds its own windowId. Conversely the windowId\nof a downstream operator is less than or equals its own windowId. The\nend of a window operation, i.e. the API call to endWindow on an operator\nrequires that all upstream operators have finished processing this\nwindow.

A stream has the\nfollowing characteristics   Tuples are always delivered in the same order in which they\n    were emitted.  Consists of a sequence of windows one after another. Each\n    window being a collection of in-order tuples.  A stream that connects two containers passes through a\n    buffer server.  All streams can be persisted (by default in HDFS).  Exactly one output port writes to the stream.  Can be read by one or more input ports.  Connects operators within an application, not outside\n    an application.  Has an unique name within an application.  Has attributes which act as hints to STRAM.   Streams have four modes, namely in-line, in-node, in-rack,\n    and other. Modes may be overruled (for example due to lack\n    of containers). They are defined as follows:   THREAD_LOCAL: In the same thread, uses thread\n    stack (intra-thread). This mode can only be used for a downstream\n    operator which has only one input port connected; also called\n    in-line.  CONTAINER_LOCAL: In the same container (intra-process); also\n    called in-container.  NODE_LOCAL: In the same Hadoop node (inter processes, skips\n    NIC); also called in-node.  RACK_LOCAL: On nodes in the same rack; also called\n    in-rack.  unspecified: No guarantee. Could be anywhere within the\n    cluster     An example of a stream declaration is given below  DAG dag = new DAG();\n \u2026\ndag.addStream( views , viewAggregate.sum, cost.data).setLocality(CONTAINER_LOCAL); // A container local  stream\ndag.addStream(\u201cclicks\u201d, clickAggregate.sum, rev.data); // An example of unspecified locality  The platform guarantees in-order delivery of tuples in a stream.\nSTRAM views each stream as collection of ordered windows. Since no tuple\ncan exist outside a window, a replay of a stream consists of replay of a\nset of windows. When multiple input ports read the same stream, the\nexecution plan of a stream ensures that each input port is logically not\nblocked by the reading of another input port. The schema of a stream is\nsame as the schema of the tuple.  In a stream all tuples emitted by an operator in a window belong\nto that window. A replay of this window would consists of an in-order\nreplay of all the tuples. Thus the tuple order within a stream is\nguaranteed. However since an operator may receive multiple streams (for\nexample an operator with two input ports), the order of arrival of two\ntuples belonging to different streams is not guaranteed. In general in\nan asynchronous distributed architecture this is expected. Thus the\noperator (specially one with multiple input ports) should not depend on\nthe tuple order from two streams. One way to cope with this\nindeterminate order, if necessary, is to wait to get all the tuples of a\nwindow and emit results in endWindow call. All operator templates\nprovided as part of   standard operator template\nlibrary   \u00a0 follow\nthese principles.  A logical stream gets partitioned into physical streams each\nconnecting the partition to the upstream operator. If two different\nattributes are needed on the same stream, it should be split using\nStreamDuplicator\u00a0operator.  Modes of the streams are critical for performance. An in-line\nstream is the most optimal as it simply delivers the tuple as-is without\nserialization-deserialization. Streams should be marked\ncontainer_local, specially in case where there is a large tuple volume\nbetween two operators which then on drops significantly. Since the\nsetLocality call merely provides a hint, STRAM may ignore it. An In-node\nstream is not as efficient as an in-line one, but it is clearly better\nthan going off-node since it still avoids the potential bottleneck of\nthe network card.  THREAD_LOCAL and CONTAINER_LOCAL streams do not use a buffer\nserver as this stream is in a single process. The other two do.",

Without the\nability to scale as load grows, or new applications with higher loads\ncome to fruition, enterprise grade SLA cannot be met. A big issue with\nthe streaming application space is that, it is not just about high load,\nbut also the fluctuations in it. There is no way to guarantee future\nload requirements and there is a big difference between high and low\nload within a day for the same feed. Traditional streaming platforms\nsolve these two cases by simply throwing more hardware at the\nproblem.  Daily spikes are managed by ensuring enough hardware for peak\nload, which then idles during low load, and future needs are handled by\na very costly re-architecture, or investing heavily in building a\nscalable distributed operating system. Another salient and often\noverlooked cost is the need to manage SLA -- let\u2019s call it  buffer capacity. Since this means computing the\npeak load within required time, that translates to allocating enough\nresources over and above peak load as daily peaks fluctuate. For example\nan average peak load of 100 resource units (cpu and/or memory and/or\nnetwork) may mean allocating about 200 resource units to be safe. A\ndistributed cluster that cannot dynamically scale up and down, in effect\npays buffer capacity per application. Another big aspect of streaming\napplications is that the load is not just ingestion rate, more often\nthan not, the internal operators produce lot more events than the\ningestion rate. For example a dimensional data (with, say  d\u00a0dimensions) computation needs 2*d -1\u00a0computations per ingested event. A lot\nof applications have over 10 dimensions, i.e over 1000 computations per\nincoming event and these need to be distributed across the cluster,\nthereby causing an explosion in the throughput (events/sec) that needs\nto be managed.  The platform is designed to handle such cases at a very low cost.\nThe platform scales linearly with Hadoop. If applications need more\nresources, the enterprise can simply add more commodity nodes to Hadoop\nwithout any downtime, and the Hadoop native platform will take care of\nthe rest. If some nodes go bad, these can be removed without downtime.\nThe daily peaks and valleys in the load are managed by the platform by\ndynamically scaling at the peak and then giving the resources back to\nHadoop during low load. This means that a properly designed Hadoop\ncluster does several things for enterprises: (a) reduces the cost of\nhardware due to use of commodity hardware (b) shares buffer capacity\nacross all applications as peaks of all applications may not align and\n(c) raises the average CPU usage on a 24x7 basis.

To address the problem, the platform offers the capability to\npartition the inflow of data so that it is divided across multiple\nphysical instances of a logical operator in the DAG. There are two\nfunctional ways to partition   Load balance: Incoming load is simply partitioned\n    into stream(s) that go to separate instances of physical operators\n    and scalability is achieved via adding more physical operators. Each\n    tuple is sent to physical operator (partition) based on a\n    round-robin or other similar algorithm.

Similarly, in the early morning, the majority\nof the accesses are from east coast of the US, with the skew shifting to\nthe west coast as the day progresses. Assume operator 1 is partitioned\ninto 1a, 1b, and 1c.  Let's see what happens if the logical operator 1 gets into a 20%,\n20%, 60% skew as shown in Figure 7. This would trigger the skew\nbalancing partition. One example of attaining balance is to merge 1a,\nand 1b to get 1a+1b in a single partition to take the load to 40%; then\nsplit 1c into two partitions 1ca and 1cb to get 30% on each of them.\nThis way STRAM is able to get back to under 50% per partition. As a live\n24x7 application, this kind of skew partitioning can be applied several\ntimes in a day. Skew-balancing at runtime is a critical feature for SLA\ncompliance; it also enables cost savings.

Let us take the same example as in Figure 7 with\nskew 20%, 20%, and 60%. To manage the load we could have either worked\non rebalancing the partition, which involves a merge and split of\npartitions to get to a new distribution or by partitioning  only\u00a0the partition with the big skew. Since the\nbest way to manage skew is to load balance, if possible, this scheme\nattempts to do so. The method is less useful than the others we discusse\n-- the main reason being that if the developer has chosen a sticky key\npartition to start with, it is unlikely that a load balancing scheme can\nhelp. Assuming that it is worthwhile to load balance, a special\none-purpose unifier can be inserted for the skew partition. If the cause\nof resource bottleneck is not the I/O, specially the I/O into the\ndownstream operator, but is the compute (memory, CPU) power of a\npartition, it makes sense to split the skew partition without having to\nchange the in-bound I/O to the upstream operator.  To trigger this users can set a limit on the ratio of maximum load\non a partition to the minimum load on a partition, and ask to use this\nscheme. STRAM would use this to load balance.The time period between\neach attempt is controlled via the same attribute to avoid rebalancing\ntoo frequently.  Figure 8 shows an example of skew load balancing partition with a\ndedicated unifier. The 20%, 20%, and 60% triggers the skew load\nbalancing partition with an unifier. Partition 1c would be split into\ntwo and it would get its own dedicated unifier. Ideally these two\nadditional partitions 1ca and 1cb will get 30% load. This way STRAM is\nable to get back to under 50% per partition. This scheme is very useful\nwhen the number of partitions is very high and we still have a bad\nskew.  In the steady state no physical partition is computing more than\n30% of the load. Memory and CPU resources are thus well distributed. The\nunifier that was inserted has to handle 60% of the load, distributed\nmore evenly, as opposed to the final unifier that had a 60% skew to\nmanage at a much higher total load.

            "text": "Let's take the case of an upstream operator oprU\u00a0that connects to a downstream operator\noprD. Let's assume the application\nis set to scale oprU by load balancing. So this could be either Nx1 or\nNxM partitioning scheme. The upstream operator oprU scales by increasing\nN. An increase in the load triggers more resource needs (CPU, Memory, or\nI/O), which in turn triggers more containers and raises N, the\ndownstream node may be impacted in a lot of situations. In this section\nwe review a method to shield oprD from dynamic changes in the execution\nplan of oprU. On aggregate operators (Sum, Count, Max, Min, Range \u2026) it\nis better to do load balanced partitioning to avoid impact of skew. This\nworks very well as each partition emits tuples at the order of number of\nkeys (range) in the incoming stream per application window. But as N\ngrows the in-bound I/O to the unifier of oprU that runs in the container\nof oprD goes up proportionately as each upstream partition sends tuples\nof the order of unique keys (range). This means that the partitioning\nwould not scale linearly. The platform has mechanisms to manage this and\nget the scale back to being linear.  Cascading unifiers are implemented by inserting a series of\nintermediate unifiers before the final unifier in the container of oprD.\nSince each unifier guarantees that the outbound I/O would be in order of\nthe number of unique keys, the unifier in the oprD container can expect\nto achieve an upper limit on the inbound I/O. The problem is the same\nirrespective of the value of M (1 or more), wherein the amount of\ninbound I/O is proportional to N, not M. Figure 8 illustrates how\ncascading unifier works.   Figure 8 shows an example where a 4x1 partition with single\nunifier is split into three 2x1 partitions to enable the final unifier\nin oprD container to get an upper limit on inbound I/O. This is useful\nto ensure that network I/O to containers is within limits, or within a\nlimit specified by users. The platform allows setting an upper limit of\nfan-in of the stream between oprU and oprD. Let's say that this is F (in\nthe figure F=2). STRAM would plan N/F (let's call it N1) containers,\neach with one unifier. The inbound fan-in to these unifiers is F. If N1  F, another level of unifiers would be inserted. Let's say at some\npoint N/(F1*F2*...Fk)   F, where K is the level of unifiers. The\noutbound I/O of each unifier is guaranteed to be under F, specially the\nunifier for oprD. This ensures that the application scales linearly as\nthe load grows. The downside is the additional latency imposed by each\nunifier level (a few milliseconds), but the SLA is maintained, and the\napplication is able to run within the resource limits imposed by YARN.\nThe value of F can be derived from any of the following   I/O limit on containers to allow proper behavior in an\n    multi-tenant environment  Load on oprD instance  Buffer server limits on fan-in, fan-out  Size of reservoir buffer for inbound fan-in   A more intriguing optimization comes when cascading unifiers are\ncombined with node-local execution plan, in which the bounds of two or\nmore containers are used and much higher local loopback limits are\nleveraged. In general the first level fan-in limit (F1) and the last\nstage fan-in limit (Fk) need not be same. In fact a much open and better\nleveraged execution plan may indeed have F1 != F2 != \u2026 != Fk, as Fk\ndetermines the fan-in for oprD, while F1, \u2026 Fk-1 are fan-ins for\nunifier-only containers.

Monitoring state as\nevery tuple is processed asynchronously in a distributed environment\nbecomes a near impossible task, and cost paid to achieve it is very\nhigh. Consequently, in the platform, state is not saved per tuple, but\nrather at window boundaries. The platform treats windows as atomic micro\nbatches. The state saving task is delegated by STRAM to the individual\noperator or container. This ensures that the bookkeeping cost is very\nlow and works in a distributed way. Thus, the state of the application\nis defined as the collection of states of every operator and the set of\nall windows stored in the buffer server. This allows STRAM to rebuild\nany part of the application from the last saved state of the impacted\noperators and the windows retained by the buffer server. The state of an\noperator is intrinsically associated with a window id. Since operators\ncan override the default checkpointing period, operators may save state\nat the end of different windows. This works because the buffer server\nsaves all windows for as long as they are needed (state in the buffer\nserver is purged once STRAM determines that it is not longer needed\nbased on checkpointing in downstream operators).  Operators can be stateless or stateful. A stateless operator\nretains no data between windows. All results of all computations done in\na window are emitted in that window. Variables in such an operator are\neither transient or are cleared by an end_window event. Such operators\nneed no state restoration after an outage. A stateful operator retains\ndata between windows and has data in checkpointed state. This data\n(state) is used for computation in future windows. Such an operator\nneeds its state restored after an outage. By default the platform\nassumes the operator is stateful. In order to optimize recovery (skip\nprocessing related to state recovery) for a stateless operator, the\noperator needs to be declared as stateless to STRAM. Operators can\nexplicitly mark themselves stateless via an annotation or an\nattribute.  Recovery mechanisms are explained later in this section. Operator\ndevelopers have to ensure that there is no dependency on the order of\ntuples between two different streams. As mentioned earlier in this\ndocument, the platform guarantees in-order tuple delivery within a\nsingle stream, For operators with multiple input ports, a replay may\nresult in a different relative order of tuples among the different input\nports. If the output tuple computation is affected by this relative\norder, the operator may have to wait for the endWindow call (at which\npoint it would have seen all the tuples from all input ports in the\ncurrent window), perform order-dependent computations correctly and\nfinally, emit results.",

            "text": "STRAM provides checkpointing parameters to StreamingContainer\nduring initialization. A checkpoint period is given to the containers\nthat have the window generators. A control tuple is sent at the end of\ncheckpoint interval. This tuple traverses through the data path via\nstreams and triggers each StreamingContainer in the path to instrument a\ncheckpoint of the operator that receives this tuple. This ensures that\nall the operators checkpoint at exactly the same window boundary (except\nin those cases where a different checkpoint interval was configured for\nan operator by the user).  The only delay is the latency of the control tuple to reach all\nthe operators. Checkpoint is thus done between the endWindow call of a\nwindow and the beginWindow call of the next window. Since most operators\nare computing in parallel (with the exception of those connected by\nTHREAD_LOCAL streams) they each checkpoint as and when they are ready\nto process the \u201ccheckpoint\u201d control tuple. The asynchronous design of\nthe platform means that there is no guarantee that two operators would\ncheckpoint at exactly the same time, but there is a guarantee that by\ndefault they would checkpoint at the same window boundary. This feature\nalso ensures that purge of old data can be efficiently done: Once the\ncheckpoint window tuple is done traversing the DAG, the checkpoint state\nof the entire DAG increments to this window id at which point prior\ncheckpoint data can be discarded.  In case of an operator that has an application window size that is\nlarger than the size of the streaming window, the checkpointing by\ndefault still happens at same intervals as with other operators. To\nalign checkpointing with application window boundary, the application\ndeveloper should set the attribute \u201cCHECKPOINT_WINDOW_COUNT\u201d to\n\u201cAPPLICATION_WINDOW_COUNT\u201d. This ensures that the checkpoint happens\nat the  end\u00a0of the application\nwindow and not within\u00a0that window.\nSuch operators now treat the application window as an atomic computation\nunit. The downside is that it does need the upstream buffer server to\nkeep tuples for the entire application window.  If an operator is completely stateless, i.e. an outbound tuple is\nonly emitted in the process\u00a0call\nand only depends on the tuple of that call, there is no need to align\ncheckpointing with application window end. If the operator is stateful\nonly within a window, the operator developer should strongly consider\ncheckpointing only on the application window boundary.  Checkpointing involves pausing an operator, serializing the state\nto persistent storage and then resuming the operator. Thus checkpointing\nhas a latency cost that can negatively affect computational throughput;\nto minimize that impact, it is important to ensure that checkpointing is\ndone with minimal required objects. This means, as mentioned earlier,\nall data that is not part of the operator state should be declared as\ntransient so that it is not persisted.  An operator developer can also create a stateless operator (marked\nwith the Stateless annotation). Stateless operators are not\ncheckpointed. Obviously, in such an operator, computation should not\ndepend on state from a previous window.  The serialized \u00a0state of an operator is stored as a file, and is\nthe state to which that the operator is restored if an outage happens\nbefore the next checkpoint. The id of the last completed window (per\noperator) is sent back to STRAM in the next heartbeat. The default\nimplementation for serialization uses KRYO. Multiple past checkpoints\nare kept per operator. Depending on the downstream checkpoint, one of\nthese are chosen for recovery. Checkpoints and buffer server state are\npurged once STRAM sees windows as fully processed in the DAG.  A complete recovery of an operator needs the operator to be\ncreated, its checkpointed state restored and then all the lost atomic\nwindows replayed by the upstream buffer server(s). The above design\nkeeps the bookkeeping cost low with quick catch up time. In the next\nsection we will see how this simple abstraction allows applications to\nrecover under different requirements.",

If multiple operators are in a container (THREAD_LOCAL\nor CONTAINER_LOCAL stream) the container recovery treats each operator\nas an independent object when figuring out the recovery steps.\nApplication developers can set any of the recovery mechanisms discussed\nbelow for node outage.  In general, the cost of recovery depends on the state of the\noperator and the recovery mechanism selected, while data loss tolerance\nis specified by the application.

It is the\nstandard way for assembling and sharing an Apache Apex application.\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\n\nPlease read \nApache Apex Development Environment Setup\n\nfor detailed instructions on:\n\n\n\n\nPre-requisite tools such as JDK, Maven, Git, etc.\n\n\nSetting up the Datatorrent sandbox, if necessary.\n\n\nCreating a new Apache Apex project using either the command line or one of the\n  common IDEs.\n\n\nRunning the unit test from the newly created project.\n\n\n\n\nWriting Your Own App Package\n\n\nPlease refer to the \nBeginner's Guide\n on the basics on how to write an Apache Apex application.  In your AppPackage project, you can add custom operators (refer to \nOperator Development Guide\n), project dependencies, default and required configuration properties, pre-set configurations and other metadata.\n\n\nAdding (and removing) project dependencies\n\n\nUnder the project, you can add project dependencies in pom.xml, or do it\nthrough your IDE.  Here\u2019s the section that describes the dependencies in\nthe default pom.xml:\n\n\n  \ndependencies\n\n    \n!-- add your dependencies here --\n\n    \ndependency\n\n      \ngroupId\norg.apache.apex\n/groupId\n\n      \nartifactId\nmalhar-library\n/artifactId\n\n      \nversion\n${apex.version}\n/version\n\n      \n!--\n           If you know your application do not need the transitive dependencies that are pulled in by malhar-library,\n           Uncomment the following to reduce the size of your app package.\n      --\n\n      \n!--\n      \nexclusions\n\n        \nexclusion\n\n          \ngroupId\n*\n/groupId\n\n          \nartifactId\n*\n/artifactId\n\n        \n/exclusion\n\n      \n/exclusions\n\n      --\n\n    \n/dependency\n\n    \ndependency\n\n      \ngroupId\norg.apache.apex\n/groupId\n\n      \nartifactId\napex-engine\n/artifactId\n\n      \nversion\n${apex.version}\n/version\n\n      \nscope\nprovided\n/scope\n\n    \n/dependency\n\n    \ndependency\n\n      \ngroupId\njunit\n/groupId\n\n      \nartifactId\njunit\n/artifactId\n\n      \nversion\n4.10\n/version\n\n      \nscope\ntest\n/scope\n\n    \n/dependency\n\n  \n/dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, as shown above, the default dependencies include\nmalhar-library in compile scope, apex-engine in provided scope, and junit\nin test scope.  Do not remove these three dependencies since they are\nnecessary for any Apex application.  You can, however, exclude\ntransitive dependencies from malhar-library to reduce the size of your\nApp Package, provided that none of the operators in malhar-library that\nneed the transitive dependencies will be used in your application.\n\n\nIn the sample application, it is safe to remove the transitive\ndependencies from malhar-library, by uncommenting the \"exclusions\"\nsection.  It will reduce the size of the sample App Package from 8MB to\n700KB.\n\n\nNote that if we exclude *, in some versions of Maven, you may get\nwarnings similar to the following:\n\n\n\n [WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.exclusions.exclusion.groupId' for\n org.apache.apex:malhar-library:jar with value '*' does not match a\n valid id pattern.\n\n [WARNING]\n [WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they\n threaten the stability of your build.\n [WARNING]\n [WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support\n building such malformed projects.\n [WARNING]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a bug in early versions of Maven 3.  The dependency exclusion is\nstill valid and it is safe to ignore these warnings.\n\n\nApplication Configuration\n\n\nA configuration file can be used to configure an application.  Different\nkinds of configuration parameters can be specified. They are application\nattributes, operator attributes and properties, port attributes, stream\nproperties and application specific properties. They are all specified\nas name value pairs, in XML format, like the following.\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n?\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\nsome_name_1\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nsome_default_value\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\nsome_name_2\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nsome_default_value\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication attributes\n\n\nApplication attributes are used to specify the platform behavior for the\napplication. They can be specified using the parameter\n\ndt.attr.\nattribute\n. The prefix \ndt\n is a constant, \nattr\n is a\nconstant denoting an attribute is being specified and \nattribute\n\nspecifies the name of the attribute. Below is an example snippet setting\nthe streaming windows size of the application to be 1000 milliseconds.\n\n\n  \nproperty\n\n     \nname\ndt.attr.STREAMING_WINDOW_SIZE_MILLIS\n/name\n\n     \nvalue\n1000\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name tag specifies the attribute and value tag specifies the\nattribute value. The name of the attribute is a JAVA constant name\nidentifying the attribute. The constants are defined in\n\ncom.datatorrent.api.Context.DAGContext\n and the different attributes can\nbe specified in the format described above.\n\n\nOperator attributes\n\n\nOperator attributes are used to specify the platform behavior for the\noperator. They can be specified using the parameter\n\ndt.operator.\noperator-name\n.attr.\nattribute\n. The prefix \ndt\n is a\nconstant, \noperator\n is a constant denoting that an operator is being\nspecified, \noperator-name\n denotes the name of the operator, \nattr\n is\nthe constant denoting that an attribute is being specified and\n\nattribute\n is the name of the attribute. The operator name is the\nsame name that is specified when the operator is added to the DAG using\nthe addOperator method. An example illustrating the specification is\nshown below. It specifies the number of streaming windows for one\napplication window of an operator named \ninput\n to be 10\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.input.attr.APPLICATION_WINDOW_COUNT\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n10\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name tag specifies the attribute and value tag specifies the\nattribute value. The name of the attribute is a JAVA constant name\nidentifying the attribute. The constants are defined in\n\ncom.datatorrent.api.Context.OperatorContext\n and the different attributes\ncan be specified in the format described above.\n\n\nOperator properties\n\n\nOperators can be configured using operator specific properties. The\nproperties can be specified using the parameter\n\ndt.operator.\noperator-name\n.prop.\nproperty-name\n. The difference\nbetween this and the operator attribute specification described above is\nthat the keyword \nprop\n is used to denote that it is a property and\n\nproperty-name\n specifies the property name.  An example illustrating\nthis is specified below. It specifies the property \nhost\n of the\nredis server for a \nredis\n output operator.\n\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.redis.prop.host\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n127.0.0.1\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name tag specifies the property and the value specifies the property\nvalue. The property name is converted to a setter method which is called\non the actual operator. The method name is composed by appending the\nword \nset\n and the property name with the first character of the name\ncapitalized. In the above example the setter method would become\n\nsetHost\n. The method is called using JAVA reflection and the property\nvalue is passed as an argument. In the above example the method \nsetHost\n\nwill be called on the \nredis\n operator with \n127.0.0.1\n as the argument.\n\n\nA property that is a simple collection like a list or a map can also be initialized\nin this way but it needs a couple of additional steps: (a) The property\nmust be initialized with an empty collection of the appropriate type.\n(b) An additional setter method for initializing items of the collection\nmust be present. For example, suppose we have properties named \nlist\n\nand \nmap\n in an operator named \nopA\n initialized with empty collections:\n\n\n  private List\nString\n list = new ArrayList\n();\n  private Map\nString, String\n map = new HashMap\n();\n\n  public List\nString\n getList() { return list; }\n  public void setList(List\nString\n v) { list = v; }\n\n  public Map\nString, String\n getMap() { return map; }\n  public void setMap(Map\nString, String\n v) { map = v; }\n\n\n\n\nYou can add items to those empty collections by using fragments like this in\nyour properties file provided you also add the setters shown below:\n\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.opA.mapItem(abc)\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n123\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.opA.mapItem(pqr)\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n567\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.opA.listItem[0]\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n1000\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.opA.listItem[1]\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n2000\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.opA.listItem[3]\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n3000\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required additional setter methods in operator \nopA\n:\n\n\n  public void setListItem(int index, String value) {\n    final int need = index - list.size() + 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i \n need; i++) list.add(null);\n    list.set(index, value);\n  }\n\n  public void setMapItem(String key, String value) {\n    map.put(key, value);\n  }\n\n\n\n\nPort attributes\n\n\nPort attributes are used to specify the platform behavior for input and\noutput ports. They can be specified using the parameter \ndt.operator.\noperator-name\n.inputport.\nport-name\n.attr.\nattribute\n\nfor input port and \ndt.operator.\noperator-name\n.outputport.\nport-name\n.attr.\nattribute\n\nfor output port. The keyword \ninputport\n is used to denote an input port\nand \noutputport\n to denote an output port. The rest of the specification\nfollows the conventions described in other specifications above. An\nexample illustrating this is specified below. It specifies the queue\ncapacity for an input port named \ninput\n of an operator named \nrange\n to\nbe 4000.\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.range.inputport.input.attr.QUEUE_CAPACITY\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n4000\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name tag specifies the attribute and value tag specifies the\nattribute value. The name of the attribute is a JAVA constant name\nidentifying the attribute. The constants are defined in\ncom.datatorrent.api.Context.PortContext and the different attributes can\nbe specified in the format described above.\n\n\nThe attributes for an output port can also be specified in a similar way\nas described above with a change that keyword \u201coutputport\u201d is used\ninstead of \u201cinputport\u201d. A generic keyword \u201cport\u201d can be used to specify\neither an input or an output port. It is useful in the wildcard\nspecification described below.\n\n\nStream properties\n\n\nStreams can be configured using stream properties. The properties can be\nspecified using the parameter\n\ndt.stream.\nstream-name\n.prop.\nproperty-name\n  The constant \u201cstream\u201d\nspecifies that it is a stream, \nstream-name\n specifies the name of the\nstream and \nproperty-name\n the name of the property. The name of the\nstream is the same name that is passed when the stream is added to the\nDAG using the addStream method. An example illustrating the\nspecification is shown below. It sets the locality of the stream named\n\u201cstream1\u201d to container local indicating that the operators the stream is\nconnecting be run in the same container.\n\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.stream.stream1.prop.locality\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nCONTAINER_LOCAL\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe property name is converted into a set method on the stream in the\nsame way as described in operator properties section above. In this case\nthe method would be setLocality and it will be called in the stream\n\u201cstream1\u201d with the value as the argument.\n\n\nAlong with the above system defined parameters, the applications can\ndefine their own specific parameters they can be specified in the\nconfiguration file. The only condition is that the names of these\nparameters don\u2019t conflict with the system defined parameters or similar\napplication parameters defined by other applications. To this end, it is\nrecommended that the application parameters have the format\n\nfull-application-class-name\n.\nparam-name\n.\n The\nfull-application-class-name is the full JAVA class name of the\napplication including the package path and param-name is the name of the\nparameter within the application. The application will still have to\nstill read the parameter in using the configuration API of the\nconfiguration object that is passed in populateDAG.\n\n\nWildcards\n\n\nWildcards and regular expressions can be used in place of names to\nspecify a group for applications, operators, ports or streams. For\nexample, to specify an attribute for all ports of an operator it can be\ndone as follows\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.range.port.*.attr.QUEUE_CAPACITY\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n4000\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wildcard \u201c*\u201d was used instead of the name of the port. Wildcard can\nalso be used for operator name, stream name or application name. Regular\nexpressions can also be used for names to specify attributes or\nproperties for a specific set.\n\n\nAdding configuration properties\n\n\nIt is common for applications to require configuration parameters to\nrun.  For example, the address and port of the database, the location of\na file for ingestion, etc.  You can specify them in\nsrc/main/resources/META-INF/properties.xml under the App Package\nproject. The properties.xml may look like:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n?\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\nsome_name_1\n/name\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\nsome_name_2\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nsome_default_value\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of an application-specific property takes the form of:\n\n\ndt.operator.{opName}.prop.{propName}\n\n\nThe first represents the property with name propName of operator opName.\n Or you can set the application name at run time by setting this\nproperty:\n\n\n    dt.attr.APPLICATION_NAME\n\n\n\nThere are also other properties that can be set.  For details on\nproperties, refer to the \nOperation and Installation Guide\n.\n\n\nIn this example, property some_name_1 is a required property which\nmust be set at launch time, or it must be set by a pre-set configuration\n(see next section).  Property some_name_2 is a property that is\nassigned with value some_default_value unless it is overridden at\nlaunch time.\n\n\nAdding pre-set configurations\n\n\nAt build time, you can add pre-set configurations to the App Package by\nadding configuration XML files under \nsrc/site/conf/\nconf\n.xml\nin your\nproject.  You can then specify which configuration to use at launch\ntime.  The configuration XML is of the same format of the properties.xml\nfile.\n\n\nApplication-specific properties file\n\n\nYou can also specify properties.xml per application in the application\npackage.  Just create a file with the name properties-{appName}.xml and\nit will be picked up when you launch the application with the specified\nname within the application package.  In short:\n\n\nproperties.xml: Properties that are global to the Configuration\nPackage\n\n\nproperties-{appName}.xml: Properties that are specific when launching\nan application with the specified appName.\n\n\nProperties source precedence\n\n\nIf properties with the same key appear in multiple sources (e.g. from\napp package default configuration as META-INF/properties.xml, from app\npackage configuration in the conf directory, from launch time defines,\netc), the precedence of sources, from highest to lowest, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nLaunch time defines (using -D option in CLI, or the POST payload\n    with the Gateway REST API\u2019s launch call)\n\n\nLaunch time specified configuration file in file system (using -conf\n    option in CLI)\n\n\nLaunch time specified package configuration (using -apconf option in\n    CLI or the conf={confname} with Gateway REST API\u2019s launch call)\n\n\nConfiguration from \\$HOME/.dt/dt-site.xml\n\n\nApplication defaults within the package as\n    META-INF/properties-{appname}.xml\n\n\nPackage defaults as META-INF/properties.xml\n\n\ndt-site.xml in local DT installation\n\n\ndt-site.xml stored in HDFS\n\n\n\n\nOther meta-data\n\n\nIn a Apex App Package project, the pom.xml file contains a\nsection that looks like:\n\n\nproperties\n\n  \napex.version\n3.2.0-incubating\n/apex.version\n\n  \napex.apppackage.classpath\\\nlib*.jar\n/apex.apppackage.classpath\n\n\n/properties\n\n\n\n\n\napex.version is the Apache Apex version that are to be used\nwith this Application Package.\n\n\napex.apppackage.classpath is the classpath that is used when\nlaunching the application in the Application Package.  The default is\nlib/*.jar, where lib is where all the dependency jars are kept within\nthe Application Package.  One reason to change this field is when your\nApplication Package needs the classpath in a specific order.\n\n\nLogging configuration\n\n\nJust like other Java projects, you can change the logging configuration\nby having your log4j.properties under src/main/resources.  For example,\nif you have the following in src/main/resources/log4j.properties:\n\n\n log4j.rootLogger=WARN,CONSOLE\n log4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\n log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\n log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} [%t] %-5p\n %c{2} %M - %m%n\n\n\n\n\nThe root logger\u2019s level is set to WARN and the output is set to the console (stdout).\n\n\nNote that by default from project created from the maven archetype,\nthere is already a log4j.properties file under src/test/resources and\nthat file is only used for the unit test.\n\n\nZip Structure of Application Package\n\n\nApache Apex Application Package files are zip files.  You can examine the content of any Application Package by using unzip -t on your Linux command line.\n\n\nThere are four top level directories in an Application Package:\n\n\n\n\n\"app\" contains the jar files of the DAG code and any custom operators.\n\n\n\"lib\" contains all dependency jars\n\n\n\"conf\" contains all the pre-set configuration XML files.\n\n\n\"META-INF\" contains the MANIFEST.MF file and the properties.xml file.\n\n\n\u201cresources\u201d contains other files that are to be served by the Gateway on behalf of the app package.\n\n\n\n\nManaging Application Packages Through DT Gateway\n\n\nThe DT Gateway provides storing and retrieving Application Packages to\nand from your distributed file system, e.g. HDFS.\n\n\nStoring an Application Package\n\n\nYou can store your Application Packages through DT Gateway using this\nREST call:\n\n\n POST /ws/v2/appPackages\n\n\n\n\nThe payload is the raw content of your Application Package.  For\nexample, you can issue this request using curl on your Linux command\nline like this, assuming your DT Gateway is accepting requests at\nlocalhost:9090:\n\n\n$ curl -XPOST -T \napp-package-file\n http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/appPackages\n\n\n\n\nGetting Meta Information on Application Packages\n\n\nYou can get the meta information on Application Packages stored through\nDT Gateway using this call.  The information includes the logical plan\nof each application within the Application Package.\n\n\n GET /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}\n\n\n\n\nGetting Available Operators In Application Package\n\n\nYou can get the list of available operators in the Application Package\nusing this call.\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/operators?parent={parent}\n\n\n\n\nThe parent parameter is optional.  If given, parent should be the fully\nqualified class name.  It will only return operators that derive from\nthat class or interface. For example, if parent is\ncom.datatorrent.api.InputOperator, this call will only return input\noperators provided by the Application Package.\n\n\nGetting Properties of Operators in Application Package\n\n\nYou can get the list of properties of any operator in the Application\nPackage using this call.\n\n\nGET  /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/operators/{className}\n\n\n\n\nGetting List of Pre-Set Configurations in Application Package\n\n\nYou can get a list of pre-set configurations within the Application\nPackage using this call.\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{packageVersion}/configs\n\n\n\n\nYou can also get the content of a specific pre-set configuration within\nthe Application Package.\n\n\n GET /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/configs/{configName}\n\n\n\n\nChanging Pre-Set Configurations in Application Package\n\n\nYou can create or replace pre-set configurations within the Application\nPackage\n\n\n PUT   /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/configs/{configName}\n\n\n\n\nThe payload of this PUT call is the XML file that represents the pre-set configuration.  The Content-Type of the payload is \"application/xml\" and you can delete a pre-set configuration within the Application Package.\n\n\n DELETE /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/configs/{configName}\n\n\n\n\nRetrieving an Application Package\n\n\nYou can download the Application Package file.  This Application Package\nis not necessarily the same file as the one that was originally uploaded\nsince the pre-set configurations may have been modified.\n\n\n GET /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/download\n\n\n\n\nLaunching an Application Package\n\n\nYou can launch an application within an Application Package.\n\n\nPOST /ws/v2/appPackages/{owner}/{pkgName}/{pkgVersion}/applications/{appName}/launch?config={configName}\n\n\n\n\nThe config parameter is optional.  If given, it must be one of the\npre-set configuration within the given Application Package.  The\nContent-Type of the payload of the POST request is \"application/json\"\nand should contain the properties to be launched with the application.\n It is of the form:\n\n\n {\nproperty-name\n:\nproperty-value\n, ... }\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of launching an application through curl:\n\n\n $ curl -XPOST -d'{\ndt.operator.console.prop.stringFormat\n:\nxyz %s\n}'\n http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/appPackages/dtadmin/mydtapp/1.0-SNAPSHOT/applications/MyFirstApplication/launch\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the \nGateway API reference\n for the complete specification of the REST API.\n\n\nExamining and Launching Application Packages Through Apex CLI\n\n\nIf you are working with Application Packages in the local filesystem and\ndo not want to deal with dtGateway, you can use the Apex Command Line Interface (apex).  Please refer to the \nGateway API\n\nto see samples for these commands.\n\n\nGetting Application Package Meta Information\n\n\nYou can get the meta information about the Application Package using\nthis Apex CLI command.\n\n\n apex\n get-app-package-info \napp-package-file\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Available Operators In Application Package\n\n\nYou can get the list of available operators in the Application Package\nusing this command.\n\n\n apex\n get-app-package-operators \napp-package-file\n \npackage-prefix\n\n [parent-class]\n\n\n\n\nGetting Properties of Operators in Application Package\n\n\nYou can get the list of properties of any operator in the Application\nPackage using this command.\n\n\napex\n get-app-package-operator-properties \n \n\n\nLaunching an Application Package\n\n\nYou can launch an application within an Application Package.\n\n\n apex\n launch [-D property-name=property-value, ...] [-conf config-name]\n [-apconf config-file-within-app-package] \napp-package-file\n\n [matching-app-name]\n\n\n\n\nNote that -conf expects a configuration file in the file system, while -apconf expects a configuration file within the app package.",

You can, however, exclude\ntransitive dependencies from malhar-library to reduce the size of your\nApp Package, provided that none of the operators in malhar-library that\nneed the transitive dependencies will be used in your application.  In the sample application, it is safe to remove the transitive\ndependencies from malhar-library, by uncommenting the \"exclusions\"\nsection.  It will reduce the size of the sample App Package from 8MB to\n700KB.

For example, suppose we have properties named  list \nand  map  in an operator named  opA  initialized with empty collections:    private List String  list = new ArrayList ();\n  private Map String, String  map = new HashMap ();\n\n  public List String  getList() { return list; }\n  public void setList(List String  v) { list = v; }\n\n  public Map String, String  getMap() { return map; }\n  public void setMap(Map String, String  v) { map = v; }  You can add items to those empty collections by using fragments like this in\nyour properties file provided you also add the setters shown below:     property \n     name dt.operator.opA.mapItem(abc) /name \n     value 123 /value \n   /property \n   property \n     name dt.operator.opA.mapItem(pqr) /name \n     value 567 /value \n   /property \n   property \n     name dt.operator.opA.listItem[0] /name \n     value 1000 /value \n   /property \n   property \n     name dt.operator.opA.listItem[1] /name \n     value 2000 /value \n   /property \n   property \n     name dt.operator.opA.listItem[3] /name \n     value 3000 /value \n   /property   The required additional setter methods in operator  opA :    public void setListItem(int index, String value) {\n    final int need = index - list.size() + 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i   need; i++) list.add(null);\n    list.set(index, value);\n  }\n\n  public void setMapItem(String key, String value) {\n    map.put(key, value);\n  }",

This guide assumes the reader\u2019s familiarity of\nApplication Package.  Please read the Application Package document to\nget yourself familiar with the concept first if you have not done so.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nYou will need have the following installed:\n\n\n\n\nApache Maven 3.0 or later (for assembling the Config Package)\n\n\nApex 3.4.0 or later (for launching the App Package with the Config\n    Package in your cluster)\n\n\n\n\nCreating Your First Configuration Package\n\n\nYou can create a Configuration Package using your Linux command line, or\nusing your favorite IDE.  \n\n\nUsing Command Line\n\n\nFirst, change to the directory where you put your projects, and create a\nDT configuration project using Maven by running the following command.\n Replace \"com.example\", \"mydtconfig\" and \"1.0-SNAPSHOT\" with the\nappropriate values:\n\n\n$ mvn archetype:generate \\\n -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.apex \\\n -DarchetypeArtifactId=apex-conf-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=3.4.0 \\\n -DgroupId=com.example -Dpackage=com.example.mydtconfig -DartifactId=mydtconfig \\\n -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n\n\nThis creates a Maven project named \"mydtconfig\". Open it with your\nfavorite IDE (e.g. NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).  Try it out by\nrunning the following command:\n\n\n$ mvn package                                                         \n\n\n\n\nThe \"mvn package\" command creates the Config Package file in target\ndirectory as target/mydtconfig.apc. You will be able to use that\nConfiguration Package file to launch an Apache Apex application.\n\n\nUsing IDE\n\n\nAlternatively, you can do the above steps all within your IDE.  For\nexample, in NetBeans, select File-\nNew Project.  Then choose \u201cMaven\u201d\nand \u201cProject from Archetype\u201d in the dialog box, as shown.\n\n\n\n\nThen fill the Group ID, Artifact ID, Version and Repository entries as\nshown below.\n\n\n\n\nGroup ID: org.apache.apex\nArtifact ID: apex-conf-archetype\nVersion: 3.4.0 (or any later version)\n\n\nPress Next and fill out the rest of the required information. For\nexample:\n\n\n\n\nClick Finish, and now you have created your own Apex\nConfiguration Package project.  The procedure for other IDEs, like\nEclipse or IntelliJ, is similar.\n\n\nAssembling your own configuration package\n\n\nInside the project created by the archetype, these are the files that\nyou should know about when assembling your own configuration package:\n\n\n./pom.xml\n./src/main/resources/classpath\n./src/main/resources/files\n./src/main/resources/META-INF/properties.xml\n./src/main/resources/META-INF/properties-{appname}.xml\n\n\n\npom.xml\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n  \ngroupId\ncom.example\n/groupId\n\n  \nversion\n1.0.0\n/version\n\n  \nartifactId\nmydtconf\n/artifactId\n\n  \npackaging\njar\n/packaging\n\n  \n!-- change these to the appropriate values --\n\n  \nname\nMy DataTorrent Application Configuration\n/name\n\n  \ndescription\nMy DataTorrent Application Configuration Description\n/description\n\n  \nproperties\n\n    \ndatatorrent.apppackage.name\nmydtapp\n/datatorrent.apppackage.name\n\n    \ndatatorrent.apppackage.minversion\n1.0.0\n/datatorrent.apppackage.minversion\n\n   \ndatatorrent.apppackage.maxversion\n1.9999.9999\n/datatorrent.apppackage.maxversion\n\n    \ndatatorrent.appconf.classpath\nclasspath/*\n/datatorrent.appconf.classpath\n\n    \ndatatorrent.appconf.files\nfiles/*\n/datatorrent.appconf.files\n\n  \n/properties\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn pom.xml, you can change the following keys to your desired values\n\n\n\n\ngroupId\n\n\nversion\n\n\nartifactId\n\n\nname\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nYou can also change the values of \n\n\n\n\ndatatorrent.apppackage.name\n\n\ndatatorrent.apppackage.minversion\n\n\ndatatorrent.apppackage.maxversion\n\n\n\n\nto reflect what app packages should be used with this configuration package.

Example:\n\n\napex\n launch mydtapp-1.0.0.apa -conf mydtconfig.apc\n\n\n\nThis command expects both the application package and the configuration package to be in the local file system.\n\n\nRelated REST API\n\n\nPOST /ws/v2/configPackages\n\n\nPayload: Raw content of configuration package zip\n\n\nFunction: Creates or replace a configuration package zip file in HDFS\n\n\nCurl example:\n\n\n$ curl -XPOST -T {name}.apc http://{yourhost:port}/ws/v2/configPackages\n\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/configPackages?appPackageName=...\nappPackageVersion=...\n\n\nAll query parameters are optional\n\n\nFunction: Returns the configuration packages that the user is authorized to use and that are compatible with the specified appPackageName, appPackageVersion and appName. \n\n\nGET /ws/v2/configPackages/\nuser\n?appPackageName=...\nappPackageVersion=...\n\n\nAll query parameters are optional\n\n\nFunction: Returns the configuration packages under the specified user and that are compatible with the specified appPackageName, appPackageVersion and appName.\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/configPackages/\nuser\n/\nname\n\n\nFunction: Returns the information of the specified configuration package\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/configPackages/\nuser\n/\nname\n/download\n\n\nFunction: Returns the raw config package file\n\n\nCurl example:\n\n\n$ curl http://{yourhost:port}/ws/v2/configPackages/{user}/{name}/download \n xyz.apc\n$ unzip -t xyz.apc\n\n\n\n\nPOST /ws/v2/appPackages/\nuser\n/\napp-pkg-name\n/\napp-pkg-version\n/applications/{app-name}/launch?configPackage=\nuser\n/\nconfpkgname\n\n\nFunction: Launches the app package with the specified configuration package stored in HDFS.\n\n\nCurl example:\n\n\n$ curl -XPOST -d \u2019{}\u2019 http://{yourhost:port}/ws/v2/appPackages/{user}/{app-pkg-name}/{app-pkg-version}/applications/{app-name}/launch?configPackage={user}/{confpkgname}",

An application may consist of one or more\noperators each of which define some logical operation to be done on the\ntuples arriving at the operator. These operators are connected together\nusing streams forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In other words, a streaming\napplication is represented by a DAG that consists of operations (called operators) and\ndata flow (called streams).\n\n\nIn this document we will discuss details on how an operator works and\nits internals. This document is intended to serve the following purposes\n\n\n\n\nApache Apex Operators\n\u00a0- Introduction to operator terminology and concepts.\n\n\nWriting Custom Operators\n\u00a0- Designing, coding and testing new operators from scratch.  Includes code examples.\n\n\nOperator Reference\n - Details of operator internals, lifecycle, and best practices and optimizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Apex Operators \n\n\nOperators - \u201cWhat\u201d in a nutshell\n\n\nOperators are independent units of logical operations which can\ncontribute in executing the business logic of a use case. For example,\nin an ETL workflow, a filtering operation can be represented by a single\noperator. This filtering operator will be responsible for doing just one\ntask in the ETL pipeline, i.e. filter incoming tuples. Operators do not\nimpose any restrictions on what can or cannot be done as part of a\noperator. An operator may as well contain the entire business logic.\nHowever, it is recommended, that the operators are light weight\nindependent tasks, in\norder to take advantage of the distributed framework that Apache Apex\nprovides.\u00a0The structure of a streaming application shares resemblance\nwith the way CPU pipelining works. CPU pipelining breaks down the\ncomputation engine into different stages viz. instruction fetch,\ninstruction decode, etc. so that each of them can perform their task on\ndifferent instructions\nin parallel. Similarly,\nApache Apex APIs allow the user to break down their tasks into different\nstages so that all of the tasks can be executed on different tuples\nin parallel.\n\n\n\n\nOperators - \u201cHow\u201d in a nutshell\n\n\nAn Apache Apex application runs as a YARN application. Hence, each of\nthe operators that the application DAG contains, runs in one of the\ncontainers provisioned by YARN.\u00a0Further, Apache Apex exposes APIs to\nallow the user to request bundling multiple operators in a single node,\na single container or even a single thread. We shall look at these calls\nin the reference sections [cite reference sections]. For now, consider\nan operator as some piece of code that runs on some machine of a YARN\ncluster.\n\n\nTypes of Operators\n\n\nAn operator works on one tuple at a time. These tuples may be supplied\nby other operators in the application or by external sources,\nsuch as a database or a message bus. Similarly, after the tuples are\nprocessed, these may be passed on to other operators, or stored into an external system. \nTherea are 3 type of operators based on function: \n\n\n\n\nInput Adapter\n - This is one of the starting points in\n    the\u00a0application DAG and is responsible for getting tuples from an\n    external system. At the same time, such data may also be generated\n    by the operator itself, without interacting with the outside\n    world.\u00a0These input tuples will form the initial universe of\n    data\u00a0that the application works on.\n\n\nGeneric Operator\n - This type of operator accepts input tuples from\n    the previous operators and passes\u00a0them on to the following operators\n    in the DAG.\n\n\nOutput Adapter\n - This is one of the ending points in the application\n    DAG and is responsible for writing the data out to some external\n    system.\n\n\n\n\nNote: There can be multiple operators of all types in an application\nDAG.\n\n\nOperators Position in a DAG\n\n\nWe may refer to operators depending on their position with respect to\none another. For any operator opr (see image below), there are two types of operators.\n\n\n\n\nUpstream operators\n - These are the operators from which there is a\n    directed path to opr\u00a0in the application DAG.\n\n\nDownstream operators\n - These are the operators to which there is a\n    directed path from opr\u00a0in the application DAG.\n\n\n\n\nNote that there are no cycles formed in the application\u00a0DAG.\n\n\n\n\nPorts\n\n\nOperators in a DAG are connected together via directed flows\ncalled streams. Each\u00a0stream\u00a0has end-points located on the operators\ncalled ports. Therea are 2 types of ports.\n\n\n\n\nInput Port\n - This is a\u00a0port through which an operator accepts input\n    tuples\u00a0from an upstream operator.\n\n\nOutput port\n - This is a\u00a0port through which an operator passes on the\n    processed data to downstream operators.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the number of input ports, an Input Adapter is an operator\nwith no input ports, a Generic operator has both input and output ports,\nwhile an Output Adapter has no output ports.

It includes all aspects of writing an operator including\ndesign, code and unit testing.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we will design and write, from scratch, an operator\ncalled Word Count. This operator will accept tuples of type String,\ncount the number of occurrences for each word appearing in the tuple and\nsend out the updated counts for all the words encountered in the tuple.\nFurther, the operator will also accept a file path on HDFS which will\ncontain the stop-words which need to be ignored when counting\noccurrences.\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nDesign of the operator must be finalized before starting to write an\noperator. Many aspects including the functionality, the data sources,\nthe types involved etc. need to be first finalized before writing the\noperator. Let us dive into each of these while considering the Word\nCount\u00a0operator.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nWe can define the scope of operator functionality using the following\ntasks:\n\n\n\n\nParse the input tuple to identify the words in the tuple\n\n\nIdentify the stop-words in the tuple by looking up the stop-word\n    file as configured\n\n\nFor each non-stop-word in the tuple, count the occurrences in that\n    tuple and add it to a global counts\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider an example. Suppose we have the following tuples flow\ninto the Word Count operator.\n\n\n\n\nHumpty dumpty sat on a wall\n\n\nHumpty dumpty had a great fall\n\n\n\n\nInitially counts for all words\u00a0is 0. Once the first tuple is processed,\nthe counts that must be emitted are:\n\n\nhumpty - 1\ndumpty - 1\nsat - 1\nwall - 1\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are ignoring the stop-words, \u201con\u201d and \u201ca\u201d in this case.\nAlso note that as a rule, we\u2019ll ignore the case of the words when\ncounting occurrences.\n\n\nSimilarly, after the second tuple is processed, the counts that must be\nemitted are:\n\n\nhumpty - 2\ndumpty - 2\ngreat - 1\nfall - 1\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we ignore the words \n\u201chad\u201d\n and \n\u201ca\u201d\n since these are stop-words.\n\n\nNote that the most recent count for any word is correct count for that\nword. In other words, any new output for a word, invalidated all the\nprevious counts for that word.\n\n\nInputs\n\n\nAs seen from the example\u00a0above, the following\u00a0inputs are expected for\nthe operator:\n\n\n\n\nInput stream whose tuple type is String\n\n\nInput HDFS file path, pointing to a file containing stop-words\n\n\n\n\nOnly one input port is needed. The stop-word file will be small enough\nto be read completely in a single read. In addition this will be a one\ntime activity for the lifetime of the operator. This does not need a\nseparate input port.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nWe can define the output for this operator in multiple ways.\n\n\n\n\nThe operator may send out the set of counts for which the counts\n    have changed after processing each tuple.\n\n\nSome applications might not need an update after every tuple, but\n    only after\u00a0a certain time duration.\n\n\n\n\nLet us try and implement both these options depending on the\nconfiguration. Let us define a\u00a0boolean configuration parameter\n\n\u201csendPerTuple\u201d\n. The value of this parameter will indicate whether the\nupdated counts for words need to be emitted after processing each\ntuple\u00a0(true)\u00a0or after a certain time duration (false).\n\n\nThe type of information the operator will be sending out on the output\nport is the same for all the cases. This will be a \n key, value \n\u00a0pair,\nwhere the key\u00a0is the word while, the value is the latest count for that\nword. This means we just need one output port on which this information\nwill go out.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nWe have the following configuration parameters:\n\n\n\n\nstopWordFilePath\n\u00a0- This parameter will store the path to the stop\n    word file on HDFS as configured by the user.\n\n\nsendPerTuple\n\u00a0- This parameter decides whether we send out the\n    updated counts after processing each tuple or at the end of a\n    window. When set to true, the operator will send out the updated\n    counts after each tuple, else it will send at the end of\n    each\u00a0window.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nThe source code for the tutorial can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nOperator Reference \n\n\nThe Operator Class\n\n\nThe operator will exist physically as a class which implements the\nOperator\u00a0interface. This interface will require implementations for the\nfollowing method calls:\n\n\n\n\nsetup(OperatorContext context)\n\n\nbeginWindow(long windowId)\n\n\nendWindow()\n\n\ntearDown()\n\n\n\n\nIn order to simplify the creation of an operator, Apache\u00a0Apex\nlibrary also provides a base class \u201cBaseOperator\u201d which has empty\nimplementations for these methods. Please refer to the \nApex Operators\n\u00a0section and the\n\nReference\n\u00a0section for details on these.\n\n\nWe extend the class \u201cBaseOperator\u201d to create our own operator\n\u201cWordCountOperator\u201d.\n\n\npublic class WordCountOperator extends BaseOperator\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nClass (Operator) properties\n\n\nWe define the following class variables:\n\n\n\n\nsendPerTuple\n\u00a0- Configures the output frequency from the operator\n\n\n\n\nprivate boolean sendPerTuple = true; // default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstopWordFilePath\n\u00a0- Stores the path to the stop words file on HDFS\n\n\n\n\nprivate String stopWordFilePath;\u00a0// no default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstopWords\n\u00a0- Stores the stop words read from the configured file\n\n\n\n\nprivate transient String[] stopWords;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglobalCounts\n\u00a0- A Map which stores the counts of all the words\n    encountered so far. Note that this variable is non transient, which\n    means that this variable is saved as part of the checkpoint and can be recovered in event of a crash.\n\n\n\n\nprivate Map\nString, Long\n globalCounts;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdatedCounts\n\u00a0- A Map which stores the counts for only the most\n    recent tuple(s). sendPerTuple configuration determines whether to store the most recent or the recent\n    window worth of tuples.\n\n\n\n\nprivate transient Map\nString, Long\n updatedCounts;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\n - The input port for the operator. The type of this input port\n    is String\u00a0which means it will only accept tuples of type String. The\n    definition of an input port requires implementation of a method\n    called process(String tuple), which should\u00a0have the processing logic\n    for the input tuple which \u00a0arrives at this input port. We delegate\n    this task to another method called processTuple(String tuple). This\n    helps in keeping the operator classes extensible by overriding the\n    processing logic for the input tuples.\n\n\n\n\npublic transient DefaultInputPort\nString\n input = new \u00a0 \u00a0\nDefaultInputPort\nString\n()\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@Override\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public void process(String tuple)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processTuple(tuple);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput - The output port for the operator. The type of this port is\n    Entry \n String, Long \n, which means the operator will emit \n word,\n    count \n pairs for the updated counts.\n\n\n\n\npublic transient DefaultOutputPort \nEntry\nString, Long\n output = new\nDefaultOutputPort\nEntry\nString,Long\n();\n\n\n\n\nThe Constructor\n\n\nThe constructor is the place where we initialize the non-transient data\nstructures,\u00a0since\nconstructor is called just once per activation of an operator. With regards to Word Count\u00a0operator, we initialize the globalCounts variable in the constructor.\n\n\nglobalCounts = Maps.newHashMap();\n\n\n\n\nSetup call\n\n\nThe setup method is called only once during an operator lifetime and its purpose is to allow \nthe operator to set itself up for processing incoming streams. Transient objects in the operator are\nnot serialized and checkpointed. Hence, it is essential that such objects initialized in the setup call. \nIn case of operator failure, the operator will be redeployed (most likely on a different container). The setup method called by the Apache Apex engine allows the operator to prepare for execution in the new container.\n\n\nThe following tasks are executed as part of the setup call:\n\n\n\n\nRead the stop-word list from HDFS and store it in the\n    stopWords\u00a0array\n\n\nInitialize updatedCounts\u00a0variable. This will store the updated\n    counts for words in most recent tuples processed by the operator.\n    As a transient variable, the value will be lost when operator fails.\n\n\n\n\nBegin Window call\n\n\nThe begin window call signals the start of an application window. With \nregards to Word Count Operator, we are expecting updated counts for the most recent window of\ndata if the sendPerTuple\u00a0is set to false. Hence, we clear the updatedCounts\u00a0variable in the begin window\ncall and start accumulating the counts till the end window call.\n\n\nProcess Tuple call\n\n\nThe processTuple\u00a0method is called by the process\u00a0method of the input\nport, input. This method defines the processing logic for the current\ntuple that is received at the input port. As part of this method, we\nidentify the words in the current tuple and update the globalCounts\u00a0and\nthe updatedCounts\u00a0variables. In addition, if the sendPerTuple\u00a0variable\nis set to true, we also emit the words\u00a0and corresponding counts in\nupdatedCounts\u00a0to the output port. Note\u00a0that in this case (sendPerTuple =\ntrue), we clear the updatedCounts\u00a0variable in every call to\nprocessTuple.\n\n\nEnd Window call\n\n\nThis call signals the end of an application window. With regards to Word\nCount Operator, we emit the updatedCounts\u00a0to the output port if the\nsendPerTuple\u00a0flag is set to false.\n\n\nTeardown call\n\n\nThis method allows the operator to gracefully shut down itself after\nreleasing the resources that it has acquired. With regards to our operator,\nwe call the shutDown\u00a0method which shuts down the operator along with any\ndownstream operators.\n\n\nTesting your Operator\n\n\nAs part of testing our operator, we test the following two facets:\n\n\n\n\nTest output of the operator after processing a single tuple\n\n\nTest output of the operator after processing of a window of tuples\n\n\n\n\nThe unit tests for the WordCount operator are available in the class\nWordCountOperatorTest.java. We simulate the behavior of the engine by\nusing the test utilities provided by Apache Apex libraries. We simulate\nthe setup, beginWindow, process\u00a0method of the input port and\nendWindow\u00a0calls and compare the output received at the simulated output\nports.\n\n\n\n\nInvoke constructor; non-transients initialized.\n\n\nCopy state from checkpoint -- initialized values from step 1 are\nreplaced.",

A data source can be a file or a message bus that contains records and a block defines a chunk of data in the source by specifying the block offset and the length of the source belonging to the block. \n\n\nWhy is it needed?\n\n\nA Block Reader is needed to parallelize reading and parsing of a single data source, for example a file. Simple parallelism of reading data sources can be achieved by multiple partitions reading different source of same type (for files see \nAbstractFileInputOperator\n) but Block Reader partitions can read blocks of same source in parallel and parse them for records ensuring that no record is duplicated or missed.\n\n\nClass Diagram\n\n\n\n\nAbstractBlockReader\n\n\nThis is the abstract implementation that serves as the base for different types of data sources. It defines how a block metadata is processed. The flow diagram below describes the processing of a block metadata.\n\n\n\n\nPorts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblocksMetadataInput: input port on which block metadata are received.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblocksMetadataOutput: output port on which block metadata are emitted if the port is connected. This port is useful when a downstream operator that receives records from block reader may also be interested to know the details of the corresponding blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessages: output port on which tuples of type \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.block.AbstractBlockReader.ReaderRecord\n are emitted. This class encapsulates a \nrecord\n and the \nblockId\n of the corresponding block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreaderContext\n\n\nThis is one of the most important fields in the block reader. It is of type \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.block.ReaderContext\n and is responsible for fetching bytes that make a record. It also lets the reader know how many total bytes were consumed which may not be equal to the total bytes in a record because consumed bytes also include bytes for the record delimiter which may not be a part of the actual record.\n\n\nOnce the reader creates an input stream for the block (or uses the previous opened stream if the current block is successor of the previous block) it initializes the reader context by invoking \nreaderContext.initialize(stream, blockMetadata, consecutiveBlock);\n. Initialize method is where any implementation of \nReaderContext\n can perform all the operations which have to be executed just before reading the block or create states which are used during the lifetime of reading the block.\n\n\nOnce the initialization is done, \nreaderContext.next()\n is called repeatedly until it returns \nnull\n. It is left to the \nReaderContext\n implementations to decide when a block is completely processed. In cases when a record is split across adjacent blocks, reader context may decide to read ahead of the current block boundary to completely fetch the split record (examples- \nLineReaderContext\n and \nReadAheadLineReaderContext\n). In other cases when there isn't a possibility of split record (example- \nFixedBytesReaderContext\n), it returns \nnull\n immediately when the block boundary is reached. The return type of \nreaderContext.next()\n is of type \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.block.ReaderContext.Entity\n which is just a wrapper for a \nbyte[]\n that represents the record and total bytes used in fetching the record.\n\n\nAbstract methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTREAM setupStream(B block)\n: creating a stream for a block is dependent on the type of source which is not known to AbstractBlockReader. Sub-classes which deal with a specific data source provide this implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR convertToRecord(byte[] bytes)\n: this converts the array of bytes into the actual instance of record type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto-scalability\n\n\nBlock reader can auto-scale, that is, depending on the backlog (total number of all the blocks which are waiting in the \nblocksMetadataInput\n port queue of all partitions) it can create more partitions or reduce them. Details are discussed in the last section which covers the \npartitioner and stats-listener\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\nmaxReaders\n: when auto-scaling is enabled, this controls the maximum number of block reader partitions that can be created.\n\n\nminReaders\n: when auto-scaling is enabled, this controls the minimum number of block reader partitions that should always exist.\n\n\ncollectStats\n: this enables or disables auto-scaling. When it is set to \ntrue\n the stats (number of blocks in the queue) are collected and this triggers partitioning; otherwise auto-scaling is disabled.\n\n\nintervalMillis\n: when auto-scaling is enabled, this specifies the interval at which the reader will trigger the logic of computing the backlog and auto-scale.\n\n\n\n\n AbstractFSBlockReader\n\n\nThis abstract implementation deals with files. Different types of file systems that are implementations of \norg.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem\n are supported. The user can override \ngetFSInstance()\n method to create an instance of a specific \nFileSystem\n. By default, filesystem instance is created from the filesytem URI that comes from the default hadoop configuration.\n\n\nprotected FileSystem getFSInstance() throws IOException\n{\n  return FileSystem.newInstance(configuration);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt uses this filesystem instance to setup a stream of type \norg.apache.hadoop.fs.FSDataInputStream\n to read the block.\n\n\n@Override\nprotected FSDataInputStream setupStream(BlockMetadata.FileBlockMetadata block) throws IOException\n{\n  return fs.open(new Path(block.getFilePath()));\n}\n\n\n\n\nAll the ports and configurations are derived from the super class. It doesn't provide an implementation of \nconvertToRecord(byte[] bytes)\n method which is delegated to concrete sub-classes.\n\n\nExample Application\n\n\nThis simple dag demonstrates how any concrete implementation of \nAbstractFSBlockReader\n can be plugged into an application. \n\n\n\n\nIn the above application, file splitter creates block metadata for files which are sent to block reader. Partitions of the block reader parses the file blocks for records which are filtered, transformed and then persisted to a file (created per block). Therefore block reader is parallel partitioned with the 2 downstream operators - filter/converter and record output operator. The code which implements this dag is below.\n\n\npublic class ExampleApplication implements StreamingApplication\n{\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration configuration)\n  {\n    FileSplitterInput input = dag.addOperator(\nFile-splitter\n, new FileSplitterInput());\n    //any concrete implementation of AbstractFSBlockReader based on the use-case can be added here.\n    LineReader blockReader = dag.addOperator(\nBlock-reader\n, new LineReader());\n    Filter filter = dag.addOperator(\nFilter\n, new Filter());\n    RecordOutputOperator recordOutputOperator = dag.addOperator(\nRecord-writer\n, new RecordOutputOperator());\n\n    dag.addStream(\nfile-block metadata\n, input.blocksMetadataOutput, blockReader.blocksMetadataInput);\n    dag.addStream(\nrecords\n, blockReader.messages, filter.input);\n    dag.addStream(\nfiltered-records\n, filter.output, recordOutputOperator.input);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Concrete implementation of {@link AbstractFSBlockReader} for which a record is a line in the file.\n   */\n  public static class LineReader extends AbstractFSBlockReader.AbstractFSReadAheadLineReader\nString\n\n  {\n\n    @Override\n    protected String convertToRecord(byte[] bytes)\n    {\n      return new String(bytes);\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Considers any line starting with a '.' as invalid.

This ensures that no line is missed or incomplete.\n\n\nThis is one of the most common ways of handling a split record. It doesn't require any further information to decide if a line is complete. However, the cost of this consistent way to handle a line split is that it always reads from the next block.\n\n\nAbstractFSLineReader\n\n\nSimilar to \nAbstractFSReadAheadLineReader\n, even this parses lines from a block. However, it binds the \nreaderContext\n field to an instance of \nReaderContext.LineReaderContext\n.\n\n\nLineReaderContext\n\n\nThis handles the line split differently from \nReadAheadLineReaderContext\n. It doesn't always read from the next block. If the end of the last line is aligned with the block boundary then it stops processing the block. It does read from the next block when the boundaries are not aligned, that is, last line extends beyond the block boundary. The result of this is an inconsistency in reading the next block.\n\n\nWhen the boundary of the last line of the previous block was aligned with its block, then the first line of the current block is a valid line. However, in the other case the bytes from the block start offset to the first end-of-line character should be ignored. Therefore, this means that any record formed by this reader context has to be validated. For example, if the lines are of fixed size then size of each record can be validated or if each line begins with a special field then that knowledge can be used to check if a record is complete.\n\n\nIf the validations of completeness fails for a line then \nconvertToRecord(byte[] bytes)\n should return null.\n\n\nFSSliceReader\n\n\nA concrete extension of \nAbstractFSBlockReader\n that reads fixed-size \nbyte[]\n from a block and emits the byte array wrapped in \ncom.datatorrent.netlet.util.Slice\n.\n\n\nThis operator binds the \nreaderContext\n to an instance of \nReaderContext.FixedBytesReaderContext\n.\n\n\nFixedBytesReaderContext\n\n\nThis implementation of \nReaderContext\n never reads beyond a block boundary which can result in the last \nbyte[]\n of a block to be of a shorter length than the rest of the records.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nreaderContext.length\n: length of each record. By default, this is initialized to the default hdfs block size.\n\n\nPartitioner and StatsListener\n\n\nThe logical instance of the block reader acts as the Partitioner (unless a custom partitioner is set using the operator attribute - \nPARTITIONER\n) as well as a StatsListener. This is because the \n\nAbstractBlockReader\n implements both the \ncom.datatorrent.api.Partitioner\n and \ncom.datatorrent.api.StatsListener\n interfaces and provides an implementation of \ndefinePartitions(...)\n and \nprocessStats(...)\n which make it auto-scalable.\n\n\nprocessStats \n\n\nThe application master invokes \nResponse processStats(BatchedOperatorStats stats)\n method on the logical instance with the stats (\ntuplesProcessedPSMA\n, \ntuplesEmittedPSMA\n, \nlatencyMA\n, etc.) of each partition. The data which this operator is interested in is the \nqueueSize\n of the input port \nblocksMetadataInput\n.\n\n\nUsually the \nqueueSize\n of an input port gives the count of waiting control tuples plus data tuples. However, if a stats listener is interested only in the count of data tuples then that can be expressed by annotating the class with \n@DataQueueSize\n. In this case \nAbstractBlockReader\n itself is the \nStatsListener\n which is why it is annotated with \n@DataQueueSize\n.\n\n\nThe logical instance caches the queue size per partition and at regular intervals (configured by \nintervalMillis\n) sums these values to find the total backlog which is then used to decide whether re-partitioning is needed. The flow-diagram below describes this logic.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this logic is to create as many partitions within bounds (see \nmaxReaders\n and \nminReaders\n above) to quickly reduce this backlog or if the backlog is small then remove any idle partitions.\n\n\ndefinePartitions\n\n\nBased on the \nrepartitionRequired\n field of the \nResponse\n object which is returned by \nprocessStats\n method, the application master invokes \n\n\nCollection\nPartition\nAbstractBlockReader\n...\n definePartitions(Collection\nPartition\nAbstractBlockReader\n...\n partitions, PartitioningContext context)\n\n\n\n\non the logical instance which is also the partitioner instance. The implementation calculates the difference between required partitions and the existing count of partitions. If this difference is negative, then equivalent number of partitions are removed otherwise new partitions are created. \n\n\nPlease note auto-scaling can be disabled by setting \ncollectStats\n to \nfalse\n. If the use-case requires only static partitioning, then that can be achieved by setting \nStatelessPartitioner\n as the operator attribute- \nPARTITIONER\n on the block reader.",

Duplicates are\nomnipresent and can be found in almost any kind of data. Most of the\ntimes it is essential to discard, or at the very least separate out the\ndata into unique\u00a0and duplicate\u00a0components. The entire purpose of this\noperator is to de-duplicate data. In other words, when data passes\nthrough this operator, it will be segregated into two different data\nsets, one containing all unique tuples, and the other containing duplicates.\n\n\n\n\nDedup - \u201cHow\u201d in a Nutshell\n\n\nIn order to quickly decide whether an incoming tuple is duplicate or\nunique, it has to store each incoming tuple (or a signature, like key\nfor example) to be used for comparison later. A plain storage for such a\nhuge data is hardly scalable. Deduper employs a large scale distributed\nhashing mechanism (known as the Bucket Store) which allows it to\nidentify if a particular tuple is duplicate or unique. Each time it\nidentifies a tuple as a unique tuple, it also stores it into a\npersistent store called the Bucket Store for lookup in the future.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are the different components of the Deduper Operator\n\n\n\n\nDedup Operator\n - This is responsible for the overall functionality\n    of the operator. This in turn makes use of other components to\n    establish the end goal of deciding whether a tuple is a duplicate of\n    some earlier tuple, or is a unique tuple.\n\n\nBucket Store\n - This is responsible for storing the unique tuples as\n    supplied by the Deduper and storing them into Buckets in HDFS.\n\n\nBucket Manager\n - Since, all of the data cannot be stored in memory,\n    this component is responsible for loading and unloading of the\n    buckets to and from the memory as requested by the Deduper.\n\n\n\n\nThis was a very small introduction to the functioning of the Deduper.\nFollowing sections will go into more detail on each of the components.\n\n\nUse case - Basic Dedup\n\n\nDedup Key\n\n\nA dedup key is a set of one or more fields in the data tuple which acts\nas the key\u00a0for the tuples. This is used by the deduper to compare tuples\nto arrive at the conclusion on whether two tuples are duplicates.\n\n\nConsider an example schema and two sample tuples\n\n\n{Name, Phone, Email, Date, State, Zip, Country}\n\nTuple 1:\n{\n  Austin U. Saunders,\n  +91-319-340-59385,\n  ausaunders@semperegestasurna.com,\n  2015-11-09 13:38:38,\n  Texas,\n  73301,\n  United States\n}\n\nTuple 2:\n{\n  Austin U. Saunders,\n  +91-319-340-59385,\n  austin@semperegestasurna.com,\n  2015-11-09 13:39:38,\n  Texas,\n  73301,\n  United States\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume that the Dedup Key is\n\n\n{Name, Phone}\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the two\ntuples are duplicates because the key fields are same in both the\ntuples. However, if we plan to make the Dedup Key as\n\n\n{Phone, Email}\n\n\n\n\nthen in this case, the two are unique tuples as the keys of both tuples\ndo not match.\n\n\nUse case Details\n\n\nConsider the case of de-duplicating a master data set which is stored in\na file. Further also consider the following schema for tuples in the\ndata set.\n\n\n{Name, Phone, Email, Date, City, Zip, Country}\n\n\n\n\nAlso consider that we need to identify unique customers from the master\ndata set. So, ultimately the output needed for the use case is two data\nsets - Unique Records\u00a0and Duplicate Records.\n\n\nAs part of configuring the operator for this use case, we need to set\nthe following parameters:\n\n\nDedup Key - This can be set as the primary key which can be used to uniquely identify a Customer. For example, we can set it to\n\n\n{Name,Email}\n\n\n\n\nThe above configuration is sufficient to resolve the use case.\n\n\n\n\nUse case - Dedup with Expiry\n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nThe Basic Dedup use case is the most straightforward and is usually\napplied when the amount of data to be processed is not huge. However, if\nthe incoming data is huge, or even never-ending, it is usually not\nnecessary to keep storing all the data. This is because in most real\nworld use cases, the duplicates occur only a short distance apart.\nHence, after a while, it is usually okay to forget the part of the\nhistory and consider only limited history for identifying duplicates, in\nthe interest of efficiency. In other words, we expire some tuples which\nare (or were supposed to be) delivered long back. Doing so, reduces the\nload on the Bucket Store which effectively deletes part of the history,\nthus making the whole process more efficient. We call this use case,\nDedup with expiry.\n\n\nExpiry Key\n\n\nThe easiest way to understand this use case is to consider time\u00a0as the\ncriteria of expiring tuples. Time\u00a0is a natural expiry key and is in line\nwith the concept of expiry. Formally, an expiry field is a field in the\ninput tuple which can be used to discard incoming tuples as expired.\nThis expiry key usually works with another parameter called Expiry\nPeriod defined next.\n\n\nExpiry Period\n\n\nThe expiry period is the value supplied by the user to define the extent\nof history which should be considered while expiring tuples.\n\n\nUse case Details\n\n\nConsider an incoming stream of system logs. The use case requires us to\nidentify duplicate log messages and pass on only the unique ones.\nAnother relaxation in the use case is that the log messages which are\nolder than a day, may not be considered and must be filtered out as\nexpired. The expiry must be measured with respect to the time stamp in\nthe logs. For example, if the timestamp in the incoming message is\n\u201c30-12-2014 00:00:00\u201d and the latest message that the system has\nencountered had the time stamp \u201c31-12-2014 00:00:00\u201d, then the incoming\nmessage must be considered as expired. However, if the incoming message\nhad any timestamp like \u201c30-12-2014 00:11:00\u201d, it must be accepted into\nthe system and check for a possible duplicate.\n\n\nThe expiry facet in the use case above gives us an advantage in that we\ndo not have to compare the incoming record with all the data to check if\nit is a duplicate. At the same time, all the data need not be stored.\nJust a day worth of data needs to be stored in order to address the\nabove use case.\n\n\nConfiguring the below parameters will solve the problem for this use\ncase:\n\n\n\n\nDedup Key\n - This is the dedup key for the incoming tuples (similar\n    to the Basic Dedup use case). This can be any key which can uniquely\n    identify a record. For log messages this can be a serial number\n    attached in the log.\n\n\nExpiry Key\n - This is the key which can help identify the expired\n    records, as explained above. In this particular use case, it can be\n    a timestamp field which indicates when the log message was\n    generated.\n\n\nExpiry Period\n - This is the period of expiry as explained above. In\n    our particular use case this will be 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of these parameters would resolve this use case.\n\n\nUse cases - Summary\n\n\n\n\nBasic Dedup\n - Deduplication of bounded datasets. Data is assumed to be bounded. This use case is not meant for never ending streams of data. For example: Deduplication of master data like customer records, product catalogs etc.\n\n\nDedup with Expiry\n - Deduplication of unlimited streams of data. This use case handles unbounded streams of data and can run forever. An expiry key and criterion is expected as part of the input which helps avoid storing all the unique data. This helps speed up performance. Following expiry keys are supported:\n\n\nTime based\n - Timestamp fields, system date, creation date, load date etc. are examples of the fields that can be used as a time based expiry key. Additionally an option can be provided so as to maintain time with respect to System time, or Tuple time\n\n\nWith respect to system time\n - Time progresses with system time. Any expiry criterions are executed with this notion of system time.\n\n\nWith respect to tuple time\n - Time progresses based on the time in the incoming tuples. Expiry criterions are executed with the notion of time indicated by the incoming tuple.\n\n\nAny Ordered Key\n - Similar to time, any non-time field can also be used as an expiry key, provided the key is also ordered (analogous to the time field). Examples include Transaction ids, Sequence Ids etc. The expiry criterion must also be in the domain of the key.\n\n\nCategorical Key\n - Any categorical key can be used for expiry, provided that data is grouped by the key. Examples include City name, Circle Id etc. In case of City name, for example, the records tend to appear for City 1 first, followed by City 2, then City 3 and so on. Any out of order cities may be considered as expired based on the configuration of the expiry criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\n\nBlock Diagram\n\n\n\n\nThe deduper has a single input port and multiple output ports.\n\n\n\n\ninput\n - This is the input port through which the tuples arrive at\n    the Deduper.\n\n\nunique\n\u00a0- This is the output port on which unique tuples are sent out\n    by the Deduper.\n\n\nduplicate\n\u00a0- This is the output port on which duplicate tuples are\n    sent out by the Deduper.\n\n\nexpired\n\u00a0- This is the output port on which expired tuples are sent\n    out by the Deduper.\n\n\nerror\n\u00a0- This is the output port on which the error tuples are sent\n    out by the Deduper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcepts\n\n\nDedup Key\n\n\nA dedup key is a set of one or more fields in the data tuple which acts\nas the key\u00a0for the tuples. This is used by the deduper to compare tuples\nto arrive at the conclusion on whether two tuples are duplicates. If\nDedup Key of two tuples match, then they are duplicates, else they are\nunique.\n\n\nExpiry Key\n\n\nA tuple may or may not have an Expiry Key. Dedup operator cannot keep\nstoring all the data that is flowing into the operator. At some point it\nbecomes essential to discard some of the historical tuples in interest\nof memory and efficiency.\n\n\nAt the same time, tuples are expected to arrive at the Dedup operator\nwithin some time after they are generated. After this time, the tuples\nmay be considered as stale or obsolete.\n\n\nIn such cases, the Deduper chooses to consider these tuples expired\u00a0and\ntakes no action but to separate out these tuples on a different port in\norder to be processed by some other operator or offline analysis.\n\n\nIn order to create a criterion for discarding such tuples, we introduce\nan Expiry Key. Looking at the value of the Expiry Key in each tuple, we\ncan decide whether or not to discard this tuple as expired.\n\n\nThe easiest way to understand this use case is to consider time\u00a0as the\ncriteria of expiring tuples. Time\u00a0is a very good and general example of\nan expiry key and is in line with the concept of expiry. Formally, an\nexpiry field is a field in the input tuple which can be used to discard\nincoming tuples as expired. There are some criteria for a field to be\nconsidered an Expiry Field. At-least one\u00a0of the following must hold for\nan Expiry Key.\n\n\n\n\nThe domain of the key must be ordered. Example - Timestamp field\n\n\nThe domain of the key must be categorical and sorted.

Keeping an ever growing cache\nin memory is not scalable. So what we need was a limited cache backed by\na persistent store. Now to reduce cache misses, we load a chunk of data\n(called Buckets), together into memory. Buckets help narrow down the\nsearch of duplicates for incoming tuples. A Bucket is an abstraction for\na collection of tuples all of which share a common hash value based on\nsome hash function. A bucket is identified using a Bucket Key, defined\nbelow. A Bucket\u00a0has a span called Bucket Span.\n\n\nBucket Span\n\n\nBucket span is simply the range of the domain that is covered by the\nBucket. This span is specified in the domain of the Expiry key. If the\nExpiry Key is time, \u00a0then the Bucket span will be specified in seconds.\nIt is only defined in case tuples have an Expiry Key.\n\n\nBucket Key\n\n\nBucket Key acts as the identifier for a Bucket. It is derived using the\nDedup Key or Expiry Key of the tuple along with the Bucket Span.\n\n\nWe define Bucket Key differently in case of Basic Dedup\u00a0and Dedup with\nExpiry.\n\n\nIn case of Basic Dedup:\n\n\nBucket Key = Hash(Dedup Key) % Number of Buckets\n\n\n\n\nIn case of Dedup with Expiry:\n\n\nBucket Key = Expiry Key / Bucket Span\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Buckets\n\n\nThe number of buckets can be given by\n\n\nNum Buckets = Expiry Period / Bucket Span.\n\n\n\n\nThis is because at any point of time, we need only store Expiry Period\nworth of data. As soon as we get a new tuple, we can forget about the\nleast recent tuple in our store, since this tuple will be expired due to\nthe most recent tuple.\n\n\nBucket Index\n\n\nA Bucket Index iterates over number of buckets. In contrast to Bucket\nKey, which continuously keeps on increasing, Bucket Index will loop\naround to 0, once it has reached value (Number of Buckets - 1).\n\n\nExample - Buckets\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\n\nAssumption 1\n\n\nThis assumption is only applicable in case of Dedup with Expiry.\n\n\nFor any two tuples, t1 and t2 having dedup keys d1 and d2, and expiry\nkeys e1 and e2, respectively, the following holds:\nIf d1 = d2, then e1 = e2\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, there may never be\u00a0two tuples t1 and t2 such that\n\n\nTuple 1: d1, e1\nTuple 2: d2, e2\nd1 = d2 and e1 != e2\n\n\n\n\nThis assumption was made with respect to certain use cases. These use\ncases follow this assumption in that the records which are duplicates\nare exactly identical. An example use case is when log messages are\nreplayed erroneously, and we want to identify the duplicate log\nmessages. In such cases, we need not worry about two different log\nmessages having the same identifier but different timestamps. Since its\na replay of the same data, the duplicate records are assumed to be\nexactly identical.\n\n\nThe reason for making this assumption was to simplify and architect the\noperator to suit only such use cases. The backend architecture for use\ncases where this assumption does not hold, is very different from the\none where this assumption holds. Hence handling the generic case could\nhave been much more complicated and inefficient.\n\n\nFlow of a Tuple through Dedup Operator\n\n\nTuples flow through the Dedup operator one by one. Deduper may choose to\nprocess a tuple immediately, or store it in some data structure for\nlater processing. We break down the processing of the Deduper by various\nstages as follows.\n\n\nDeduper View\n\n\nA tuple always arrives at the input port\u00a0of the Dedup operator. Once\narrived, the Deduper does the following tasks.\n\n\nIdentify Bucket Key\n\n\nIdentify the Bucket Key\u00a0of the tuple. Bucket key identifies the Bucket\nto which this tuple belongs. In case of the basic dedup use case, the\nBucket Key will be calculated as follows:\n\n\nBucket Key = Hash(Dedup Key) % Number of Buckets\n\n\n\n\nIn case of Dedup with expiry, we calculate the Bucket key as\n\n\nBucket Key = Expiry Key / Bucket Span\n\n\n\n\nCheck if tuple is Expired\n\n\nThis is only applicable in case of Dedup with expiry. The following\ncondition can be used to check if the tuple is expired.\n\n\nif ( Latest Point - Expiry Key \n Expiry Point ) then Expired\n\n\n\n\nIf the tuple is expired, then put it out to the expired port.\n\n\nCheck if tuple is a Duplicate or Unique\n\n\nOnce a tuple passes the check of expiry, we proceed to check if the\ntuple already has a duplicate tuple which is not expired. Note that if\nthe tuple in question is not expired, the duplicate will also not have\nexpired due to the assumption listed \nhere\n.\n\n\nDuplicates of the tuple being processed, if any, will be available only\nin the bucket identified by the Bucket Key identified in the \nfirst\nstep\n. The amount of physical memory available with the\nDedup operator may not be sufficient to hold all the buckets in memory.\nHence at any given point in time, only a configured maximum number of\nbuckets can be kept in memory. The Deduper follows different paths\ndepending on the availability of the required bucket in memory.\n\n\nCase I - Bucket available in memory\n\n\nIn case the bucket with key Bucket Key\u00a0is available in memory, the\nDeduper simply checks if there is a tuple in the bucket with the same\nDedup Key as the one currently being processed. If, so, then the tuple\nbeing processed is deemed to be a duplicate and put out on the\nDuplicate\u00a0port. If not, then the tuple being processed is deemed to be\nunique and put out on the Unique\u00a0port. If the tuple is unique,\nadditionally it is also added to the bucket for future references.\n\n\nCase II - Bucket not in memory\n\n\nIn case the bucket with key Bucket Key\u00a0is not available in memory, the\nDeduper requests the Bucket Manager to load the bucket with key Bucket\nKey\u00a0from the Bucket Store. This request is processed by the Bucket\nManager in a separate asynchronous thread as detailed\n\nhere\n. Additionally the Deduper also inserts the tuple\nbeing processed into a waiting events\u00a0queue for later processing. After\nthis, the Deduper cannot proceed until the bucket is loaded by the\nBucket Manager and hence proceeds to process another tuple. Next section\ndetails the process after the bucket is loaded by the Bucket Manager.\n\n\nHandling tuples after Buckets are loaded\n\n\nThe Bucket Manager would load all the buckets requested by the Deduper\nand add them to a fetched buckets\u00a0queue. During the span of one\napplication window of the Deduper, it will process all the tuples on its\ninput port. Processing here could mean one of the below:\n\n\n\n\nThe bucket for a tuple was already available in memory and hence the\n    deduper could conclude whether a tuple is a duplicate or unique.\n\n\nThe bucket for a tuple was not available in memory and a request was\n    made to the Bucket Manager for asynchronously loading that\n    particular bucket in memory.\n\n\n\n\nAfter processing all the tuples as above, the Deduper starts processing\nthe tuples in the waiting events\u00a0queue as mentioned in section \nCase II\n- Bucket not in memory\n. For each of these waiting\ntuples, a corresponding bucket is loaded by the Bucket Manager in the\nfetched buckets\u00a0queue. Using these fetched buckets, the Deduper can\nresolve the pending tuples as duplicate or unique. This is done in the\nsame way as for \nBuckets available in memory\n.\n\n\nBucket Manager\n\n\nBucket manager is responsible for loading and unloading of buckets to\nand from memory. Bucket manager maintains a requested buckets\u00a0queue\nwhich holds the requests (in form of bucket keys) from the Deduper,\nindicating which buckets need to be loaded from the Bucket Store. The\nrequests are processed by the Bucket Manager one by one. The first step\nis to identify the Bucket Index for bucket key.\n\n\nIdentify Bucket Index\n\n\nBucket index is discussed \nhere\n. Bucket index can be\ncalculated as follows:\n\n\nBucket Index = Requested Bucket Key % Number of Buckets,\n\n\n\n\nwhere Number of Buckets is as defined \nhere\n.\n\n\nRequest Bucket Load from Store\n\n\nOnce we have the Bucket Index, the Bucket Store is requested to fetch\nthe corresponding bucket \u00a0and load it into memory. This is a blocking\ncall and the Bucket Manager waits while the Bucket Store fetches the\ndata from the store. Once the data is available, the Bucket Manager\nbundles the data into a bucket and adds it to the fetched buckets\u00a0queue\nmentioned \nhere\n. We detail the process of fetching the\nbucket data from the store in \nthis\n\u00a0section.\n\n\nBucket Eviction\n\n\nIt may not be efficient or even possible in some cases to keep all the\nbuckets into memory. This is the reason the buckets are persisted to the\nHDFS store every window. This makes it essential to off load some of the\nbuckets from memory so that new buckets can be loaded. The policy\nfollowed by the Bucket Manager is the least recently used policy.\nWhenever the Bucket Manager needs to load a particular bucket into\nmemory, it identifies a bucket in memory which has been accessed least\nrecently and unloads it from memory. No other processing has to be done\nin this case. Upon unloading, it informs the listeners (the Deduper\nthread) that the particular bucket has been off loaded from memory and\nis no longer available.\n\n\nBucket Store\n\n\nThe Bucket Store is responsible for fetching and storing the data from a\npersistent store. In this case, HDFS is used as the persistent store and\nHDFSBucketStore is responsible for interacting with the store.\n\n\nData Format\n\n\nBucket store persists the buckets onto the HDFS. This is typically done\nevery window, although this can be configured to be done every\ncheckpoint window. This data is stored as files on HDFS. Every write\ni.e. new unique records generated per window (or per checkpoint window)\nis written into a new file on HDFS. The format of the file is given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nAll the unique records (actually, just keys, since dedup requires just\nstorage of keys) that are received in a window, are collected in a set\nof buckets and written one after the other serially in a file on HDFS.\nThis data is indexed in case it needs to be read back. Index structures\nare described in the \nData Structures\n\u00a0section.\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\nHDFS Bucket Store keeps the information about the buckets and their\nlocations in various data structures.\n\n\n\n\nBucket Positions\n - This data structure stores for each bucket index,\n    the files and the offset within those files where the data for the\n    bucket is stored. Since the data for a single bucket may be spread\n    across multiple files, the number of files and their offsets may be\n    multiple.\n\n\nWindow To Buckets\n - This data structure keeps track of what buckets\n    were modified in which window. This is essentially a multi map of\n    window id to the set of bucket indexes that were written in that\n    window.\n\n\nWindow to Timestamp\n - This data structure keeps track of the maximum\n    timestamp within a particular window file. This gives an indication\n    as to how old is the data in the window file and helps in\n    identifying window files that can be deleted entirely.\n\n\n\n\nBucket Fetch\n\n\nFor fetching a particular bucket, a bucket index is passed to the HDFS\nbucket store. Using the bucket index, a list of window files is\nidentified which contains the data for this index. The bucket positions\ndata structure is used for this purpose. For each such window file, the\nBucket Store forks off a thread to fetch that particular window file\nfrom HDFS. Effectively all the window files which contain data for a\nparticular bucket index, are fetched in parallel from the HDFS. Once\nfetched, the data is bundled together and returned to the calling\nfunction i.e. the Bucket Manager.",

The process of receiving individual events, aggregating them over a duration, and using parameters to observe trends is referred to as \nDimensions Computation\n.\n\n\nThis document provides an overview of \nDimensions Computation\n, as well as instructions for using DataTorrent's operators to easily add dimensions computation to an Apache Apex application.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWhat is Dimensions Computation?\n\n\nDimensions Computation is a powerful mechanism that allows for spotting trends in streaming data in real-time. This tutorial will cover the concepts behind Dimensions Computation and provide details on the process of performing Dimensions Computation. We will also show you how to use Data Torrent's out of the box operators to easily add Dimensions Computation to an application.\n\n\nDimensions Computation\n provides a way for businesses to perform aggregations on configured numeric data. The \nDimensionsComputation\n operator works along with the \nDimensionStore\n operator, which provides the capability for applications to display historical data and trends.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n\nKey set\n\n\nA key set is a set of fields in the incoming tuple that is used to combine data for aggregation.\n\n\nValue set\n\n\nA value set is the set of fields in the incoming tuple on which \nAggregator\n(s)  are applied.\n\n\nAggregator\n\n\nAn aggregator is a mathematical function that is  applied on value fields in an incoming tuple. Examples of aggregators are SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and AVERAGE.\n\n\nAggregates\n\n\nAggregates are objects containing the aggregated values for a configured value set and key combination.\n\n\nTime buckets\n\n\nTime buckets indicate the duration for which the floor time is calculated. For example, a for a time bucket of 1 minute, the floor time-value for both * 12:\n01:34\n PM * and * 12:\n01:59\n PM * will be * 12:\n01:00\n PM\n. Similarly, for an hourly time bucket, floor time-value for * \n15\n:02:34 PM\n and * \n15\n:34:00 PM\n will be * \n15:00:00\n PM\n.\n\n\nAfter calculating the floor value for a duration, the time-value becomes a key. Currently supported time buckets are:  1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour, and 1 day.\n\n\nCombinations\n\n\nCombinations indicate a group of the keys that are used for aggregate computations.\n\n\nIncremental \nAggregators\n\n\nIncremental aggregators are aggregate functions for which computations are possible only by using previous aggregate value and the new value. For example,\n\n\nSUM = {Previous_SUM} + {Current_Value}\nCOUNT = {Previous_COUNT}  + 1\nMIN = ( {Current_Value} \n {Previous_MIN} ) ? {Current_Value} : {Previous_MIN}\n\n\n\n\nOn-the-fly \nAggregators\n (OTF Aggregators)\n\n\nOn-the-fly aggregators are the aggregate functions that use the result of multiple incremental aggregators, and can be calculated on-the-fly if necessary. For example,\n\n\nAVERAGE = {Current_SUM} / {Current_COUNT}\n\n\n\n\nDimensionsComputation operator\n\n\nThe DimensionsComputation operator  is an Operator that performs intermediate aggregations using incremental aggregators.\n\n\nDimensionsStore operator\n\n\nThe DimensionsStore operator  is an Operator that performs transient and final aggregations on the data generated by the Dimensions Computations operator. It maintains the historical data for aggregates to ensure a meaningful  historical view.\n\n\nDimensions Computation use cases\n\n\nConsider the case of a digital advertising publisher who receives thousands of click events every second. The history of individual clicks and impressions doesn't divulge details about users and the advertisements. A technique for deriving meaning out of such data is to observe the total number of clicks and impressions every second, minute, hour, and day. Such a technique might be  helpful for determining global trends in the advertising system, but may not provide enough granularity for localized trends. For example, the total clicks and impressions over a duration might lack in usefulness, however, the total clicks and impressions for a particular advertiser, a particular geographical area, or a combination of the two can provide actionable insight.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nDimensions Computation requires 4 operators working in sync: DimensionsComputation, DimensionsStore, Query, and QueryResult. Given \nDAG\n is for a complete Dimensions Computation application.\n\n\nThe operators within Dimensions Computation are described in detail.\n\n\nDimensionsComputation\n\n\nThe DimensionsComputation operator works only with incremental aggregates. The incoming data stream contains tuples that are Plain Old Java Objects (POJO), which contain data required for aggregations.\nDepending on the \nconfiguration\n, the DimensionsComputation operator applies incremental aggregators on the value set of the tuple data within a boundary of an application window. At the end of the application window, the aggregate value is reset to calculate the new aggregates. Thus, discrete aggregates are generated by DimensionsComputation operator for every application window. This output is used by the DimensionStore operator (labeled as Store in \nDAG\n) for calculating cumulative aggregates.\n\n\nDimensionsStore\n\n\nThe DimensionsStore operator uses the discrete aggregates generated by the DimensionsComputation operator to generate cumulative aggregates in turn. Because the aggregates generated by the DimensionsComputation operator are incremental aggregates, the sum of multiple such aggregates provides cumulative aggregates as follows:\n\n\nSUM1 = SUM(Value11, Value12, ...)\nSUM2 = SUM(Value21, Value22, ...)\n\n{Cumulative_SUM} = SUM1 + SUM2\n\n\n\n\nThe DimensionsStore operator also stores transient aggregates in a persistent proprietary store called HDHT. The DimensionsStore operator uses HDHT to present the requested historical data.\n\n\nQuery\n\n\nThe Query operator interfaces with the \npubsub server\n of \nDataTorrent Gateway\n. The browser creates a websocket connection with the  pubsub server hosted by DataTorrent Gateway. The Dashboard UI Widgets send queries to the pubsub server via this connection. The Query operator subscribes to the configured pubsub topic for receiving queries. These queries are parsed by the Query operator and passed onto DimensionsStore to fetch data from HDHT Store.\n\n\nQueryResult\n\n\nThe QueryResult operator gets the result from the DimensionsStore operator for a given query. The results are reconstructed into a format that is understood by a widget. After the results are reconstructed into the required format, they are sent to the \npubsub server\n for publishing to UI widgets.\n\n\nDAG \n\n\n\n\nDimensions Computation Configuration \n\n\nConfiguration Definitions\n\n\nThe configuration of Dimensions Computation is divided into: Dimensions Computation Schema Configuration and Operator Configurations as follows:\n\n\nDimensions Computation Schema Configuration\n\n\nThe Dimensions Computation Schema provides the Dimensions Computation operator with information about the aggregations. The schema looks like this:\n\n\n{\nkeys\n:[{\nname\n:\npublisher\n,\ntype\n:\nstring\n,\nenumValues\n:[\ntwitter\n,\nfacebook\n,\nyahoo\n]},\n         {\nname\n:\nadvertiser\n,\ntype\n:\nstring\n,\nenumValues\n:[\nstarbucks\n,\nsafeway\n,\nmcdonalds\n]},\n         {\nname\n:\nlocation\n,\ntype\n:\nstring\n,\nenumValues\n:[\nN\n,\nLREC\n,\nSKY\n,\nAL\n,\nAK\n]}],\n \ntimeBuckets\n:[\n1m\n,\n1h\n,\n1d\n],\n \nvalues\n:\n  [{\nname\n:\nimpressions\n,\ntype\n:\nlong\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nCOUNT\n,\nAVG\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\nclicks\n,\ntype\n:\nlong\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nCOUNT\n,\nAVG\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\ncost\n,\ntype\n:\ndouble\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nCOUNT\n,\nAVG\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\nrevenue\n,\ntype\n:\ndouble\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nCOUNT\n,\nAVG\n]}],\n \ndimensions\n:\n  [{\ncombination\n:[]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nlocation\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nadvertiser\n], \nadditionalValues\n:[\nimpressions:MIN\n, \nclicks:MIN\n, \ncost:MIN\n, \nrevenue:MIN\n, \nimpressions:MAX\n, \nclicks:MAX\n, \ncost:MAX\n, \nrevenue:MAX\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\npublisher\n], \nadditionalValues\n:[\nimpressions:MIN\n, \nclicks:MIN\n, \ncost:MIN\n, \nrevenue:MIN\n, \nimpressions:MAX\n, \nclicks:MAX\n, \ncost:MAX\n, \nrevenue:MAX\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nadvertiser\n,\nlocation\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\npublisher\n,\nlocation\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\npublisher\n,\nadvertiser\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\npublisher\n,\nadvertiser\n,\nlocation\n]}]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe schema configuration is a JSON string that contains the following information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeys:\n - This contains the set of keys derived from an input tuple. The \nname\n field stands for the name of the field from input tuple. The \ntype\n can be defined for individual keys. The probable values for individual keys can be provided using \nenumValues\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalues:\n - This contains the set of fields from an input tuple on which aggregates are calculated. The \nname\n field stands for the name of the field from an input tuple. The \ntype\n can be defined for individual keys. The \naggregators\n can be defined separately for individual values. Only configured aggregator functions are executed on values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeBuckets:\n - This can be used to specify the time bucket over which aggregations occur. Possible values for timeBuckets are \n\"1m\", \"1h\", \"1d\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndimensions:\n - This defines the combinations of keys that are used for grouping data for aggregate calculations. This can be mentioned in \ncombination\n with the JSON key. \nadditionalValues\n can be used for mentioning additional aggregators for any \nvalue\n. For example, \nimpressions:MIN\n indicates that for a given combination, calculate \"\nMIN\n\" for value \"\nimpression\n\" as well.\nBy default, the down time rounded off to the next value as per time bucket is always considered as one of the keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator Configurations\n\n\nOperator configurations is another set of configuration that can be used to configure individual operators.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\ndt.operator.QueryResult.topic:\n - This is the name of the topic on which UI widgets listen for results.\n\n\ndt.operator.Query.topic:\n - his is the name of the topic on which Query operator listen for queries.\n\n\ndt.operator.QueryResult.numRetries\n - This property indicates the maximum number of times the QueryResult operator should retry sending data. This value is usually high.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\ndt.operator.DimensionsComputation.attr.PARTITIONER:\n - This attribute determines the number of  partitions for DimensionsComputation. Adding more partitions means data is  processed in parallel. If this attribute is not provided, a single partition is created. Refer to the \nPartitioning\n section for details on partitioning.\n\n\ndt.operator.DimensionsComputation.attr.MEMORY_MB:\n - This attribute determines the  memory that should be assigned to the DimensionsComputations operator. If this attribute is not provided, the default value of  1 GB is used.\n\n\ndt.operator.Store.attr.MEMORY_MB:\n - This attribute determines the memory that should be assigned to DimensionsStore operator. If this attribute is not provided, the default value of 1 GB is used.\n\n\ndt.port.*.attr.QUEUE_CAPACITY\n - This attribute determines the number of tuples the buffer server can cache without blocking the input stream to the port. For peak activity, we  recommend increasing QUEUE_CAPACITY to a higher value such as 32000. If this attribute is not provided, the default value of 1024 is used.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Dimensions Computation\n\n\nWhen Dimension Computation  is launched, the visualization of aggregates over a duration can be seen by adding a widget to a dtDashboard. dtDashboard is the self-service real-time and historical data visualization interface. Rapidly gaining insight and reducing time to action provides the greatest value to an organization. DataTorrent RTS provides self-service data visualization for the business user enabling them to not only see dashboards and reports an order of magnitude faster, but to also create and share customer reports.To derive more value out of dashboards, you can add widgets to the dashboards. Widgets are charts in addition to the default charts that you can see on the dashboard.\n\n\nAnd example of a Dashboard UI Widget is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCreating Dimensions Computation Application\n\n\nConsider an example of the advertising publisher. Typically, an advertising publisher receives a packet of information for every event related to their  advertisements.\n\n\nSample publisher event\n\n\nAn event might look like this:\n\n\npublic class AdEvent\n{\n  //The name of the company that is advertising\n  public String advertiser;\n  //The geographical location of the person initiating the event\n  public String location;\n  //How much the advertiser was charged for the event\n  public double cost;\n  //How much revenue was generated for the advertiser\n  public double revenue;\n  //The number of impressions the advertiser received from this event\n  public long impressions;\n  //The number of clicks the advertiser received from this event\n  public long clicks;\n  //The timestamp of the event in milliseconds\n  public long time;\n\n  public AdEvent() {}\n\n  public AdEvent(String advertiser, String location, double cost, double revenue,\n                 long impressions, long clicks, long time)\n  {\n    this.advertiser = advertiser;\n    this.location = location;\n    this.cost = cost;\n    this.revenue = revenue;\n    this.impressions = impressions;\n    this.clicks = clicks;\n    this.time = time;\n  }\n\n  /* Getters and setters go here */\n}\n\n\n\n\nCreating an Application using out-of-the-box operators\n\n\nDimensions Computation can be created using out-of-the-box operators from the Megh and Malhar library. A sample is given below:\n\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation(name=\nAdEventDemo\n)\npublic class AdEventDemo implements StreamingApplication\n{\n  public static final String EVENT_SCHEMA = \nadsGenericEventSchema.json\n;\n\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration conf)\n  {\n    //This loads the eventSchema.json file which is a jar resource file.\n    // eventSchema.json contains the Dimensions Schema using which aggregations is configured.\n    String eventSchema = SchemaUtils.jarResourceFileToString(\neventSchema.json\n);\n\n    // Operator that receives Ad Events\n    // This can be coming from any source as long as the operator can convert the data into AdEventReceiver object.\n    AdEventReceiver receiver = dag.addOperator(\nEvent Receiver\n, AdEventReceiver.class);\n\n    //Adding Dimensions Computation operator into DAG.\n    DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaPOJO dimensions = dag.addOperator(\nDimensionsComputation\n, DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaPOJO.class);\n\n    // This defines the name present in input tuple to the name of the getter method to be used to get the value of the field.\n    Map\nString, String\n keyToExpression = Maps.newHashMap();\n    keyToExpression.put(\nadvertiser\n, \ngetAdvertiser()\n);\n    keyToExpression.put(\nlocation\n, \ngetLocation()\n);\n    keyToExpression.put(\ntime\n, \ngetTime()\n);\n\n    // This defines value to expression mapping for value field name to the name of the getter method to get the value of the field.\n    Map\nString, String\n valueToExpression = Maps.newHashMap();\n    valueToExpression.put(\ncost\n, \ngetCost()\n);\n    valueToExpression.put(\nrevenue\n, \ngetRevenue()\n);\n    valueToExpression.put(\nimpressions\n, \ngetImpressions()\n);\n    valueToExpression.put(\nclicks\n, \ngetClicks()\n);\n\n    dimensions.setKeyToExpression(keyToExpression);\n    dimensions.setAggregateToExpression(aggregateToExpression);\n    dimensions.setConfigurationSchemaJSON(eventSchema);\n\n    // This configures the unifier. The purpose of this unifier is to combine the partial aggregates from different partitions of DimensionsComputation operator into single stream.\n    dimensions.setUnifier(new DimensionsComputationUnifierImpl\nInputEvent, Aggregate\n());\n\n    // Add Dimension Store operator to DAG.\n    AppDataSingleSchemaDimensionStoreHDHT store = dag.addOperator(\nStore\n, AppDataSingleSchemaDimensionStoreHDHT.class);\n\n    // This configure the Backend HDHT store of DimensionStore operator. This backend will be used to persist the Historical Aggregates Data.\n    TFileImpl hdsFile = new TFileImpl.DTFileImpl();\n    hdsFile.setBasePath(\ndataStorePath\n);\n    store.setFileStore(hdsFile);\n    store.setConfigurationSchemaJSON(eventSchema);\n\n    // This configures the Query and QueryResult operators to the gateway address. This is needs for pubsub communication of queries/results between operators and pubsub server.\n    String gatewayAddress = dag.getValue(DAG.GATEWAY_CONNECT_ADDRESS);\n    URI uri = URI.create(\nws://\n + gatewayAddress + \n/pubsub\n);\n    PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery wsIn = dag.addOperator(\nQuery\n, PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery.class);\n    wsIn.setUri(uri);\n    PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult wsOut = dag.addOperator(\nQueryResult\n, PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult.class);\n    wsOut.setUri(uri);\n\n    // Connecting all together.\n    dag.addStream(\nQuery\n, wsIn.outputPort, store.query);\n    dag.addStream(\nQueryResult\n, store.queryResult, wsOut.input);\n    dag.addStream(\nInputStream\n, receiver.output, dimensions.input);\n    dag.addStream(\nDimensionalData\n, dimensions.output, store.input);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration for Sample Predefined Use Cases\n\n\nThe following configuration can be used for the predefined use case of the advertiser-publisher.\n\n\nDimensions Schema Configuration\n\n\n{\nkeys\n:[{\nname\n:\nadvertiser\n,\ntype\n:\nstring\n},\n         {\nname\n:\nlocation\n,\ntype\n:\nstring\n}],\n \ntimeBuckets\n:[\n1m\n,\n1h\n,\n1d\n],\n \nvalues\n:\n  [{\nname\n:\nimpressions\n,\ntype\n:\nlong\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nMAX\n,\nMIN\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\nclicks\n,\ntype\n:\nlong\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nMAX\n,\nMIN\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\ncost\n,\ntype\n:\ndouble\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nMAX\n,\nMIN\n]},\n   {\nname\n:\nrevenue\n,\ntype\n:\ndouble\n,\naggregators\n:[\nSUM\n,\nMAX\n,\nMIN\n]}],\n \ndimensions\n:\n  [{\ncombination\n:[]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nlocation\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nadvertiser\n]},\n   {\ncombination\n:[\nadvertiser\n,\nlocation\n]}]\n}\n\n\n\n\nOperator Configuration\n\n\nNote:\n This operator configuration is used for an application where the input data rate is high. To sustain the load, the Dimensions Computation operator is partitioned 8 times, and the queue capacity is increased.\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n standalone=\nno\n?\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.DimensionsComputation.attr.PARTITIONER\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:8\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.DimensionsComputation.attr.MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n16384\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n     \nname\ndt.port.*.attr.QUEUE_CAPACITY\n/name\n\n     \nvalue\n32000\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.Query.topic\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nAdsEventQuery\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.operator.QueryResult.topic\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nAdsEventQueryResult\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above operator configuration is to be used for a highly loaded application where the input rate is quite high. To sustain the load, the Dimensions Computation operator is partitioned 8 times and the queue capacity is also increased.\n\n\nAdvanced Concepts\n\n\nPartitioning \n\n\nThe Dimensions Computation operator can be statically partitioned for higher processing throughput. This can be done by adding the following attributes in the \nproperties.xml\n file, or in the \ndt-site.xml\n file.\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.DimensionsComputations.attr.PARTITIONER\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.partitioner.StatelessPartitioner:8\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThis adds the PARTITIONER attribute. This attribute creates a StatelessPartitioner for the DimensionsComputation operator. The parameter of \n8\n is going to partition the operator 8 times.\nThe StatelessPartitioner ensures that the operators are clones of each other. The tuples passed to individual clones of operators are decided based on the hashCode of the tuple.\n\n\nAlong with partitioned DimensionsComputation, there also comes a unifier which combines all the intermediate results from individual DimensionsComputation operators into a single stream. This stream is then passed to Dimensions Store.\nFollowing code needs to be added in populateDAG for adding an Unifier:\n\n\nDimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaPOJO dimensions = dag.addOperator(\nDimensionsComputation\n, DimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchemaPOJO.class);\ndimensions.setUnifier(new DimensionsComputationUnifierImpl\nInputEvent, Aggregate\n());\n\n\n\n\nHere the unifier used is \nDimensionsComputationUnifierImpl\n which is an out-of-the-box operator present in the DataTorrent distribution.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAggregating huge amounts of data in real time is a major challenge that many enterprises face today. Dimension Computation provides a valuable way in which to think about the problem of aggregating data, and Data Torrent provides an implementation of of Dimension Computation that allows users to integrate data aggregation with their applications with minimal effort.",

            "text": "AbstractFileOutputOperator\n\n\nThe abstract file output operator in Apache Apex Malhar library \n \nAbstractFileOutputOperator\n writes streaming data to files. The main features of this operator are:\n\n\n\n\nPersisting data to files.\n\n\nAutomatic rotation of files based on:\n\n  a. maximum length of a file.\n\n  b. time-based rotation where time is specified using a count of application windows.\n\n\nFault-tolerance.\n\n\nCompression and encryption of data before it is persisted.\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial we will cover the details of the basic structure and implementation of all the above features in \nAbstractFileOutputOperator\n. Configuration items related to each feature are discussed as they are introduced in the section of that feature.\n\n\nPersisting data to files\n\n\nThe principal function of this operator is to persist tuples to files efficiently. These files are created under a specific directory on the file system. The relevant configuration item is:\n\n\nfilePath\n: path specifying the directory where files are written.\n\n\nDifferent types of file system that are implementations of \norg.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem\n are supported. The file system instance which is used for creating streams is constructed from the \nfilePath\n URI.\n\n\nFileSystem.newInstance(new Path(filePath).toUri(), new Configuration())\n\n\n\n\nTuples may belong to different files therefore expensive IO operations like creating multiple output streams, flushing of data to disk, and closing streams are handled carefully.\n\n\nPorts\n\n\n\n\ninput\n: the input port on which tuples to be persisted are received.\n\n\n\n\nstreamsCache\n\n\nThis transient state caches output streams per file in memory. The file to which the data is appended may change with incoming tuples. It will be highly inefficient to keep re-opening streams for a file just because tuples for that file are interleaved with tuples for another file. Therefore, the operator maintains a cache of limited size with open output streams.\n\n\nstreamsCache\n is of type \ncom.google.common.cache.LoadingCache\n. A \nLoadingCache\n has an attached \nCacheLoader\n which is responsible to load value of a key when the key is not present in the cache. Details are explained here- \nCachesExplained\n.\n\n\nThe operator constructs this cache in \nsetup(...)\n. It is built with the following configuration items:\n\n\n\n\nmaxOpenFiles\n: maximum size of the cache. The cache evicts entries that haven't been used recently when the cache size is approaching this limit. \nDefault\n: 100\n\n\nexpireStreamAfterAcessMillis\n: expires streams after the specified duration has passed since the stream was last accessed. \nDefault\n: value of attribute- \nOperatorContext.SPIN_MILLIS\n.\n\n\n\n\nAn important point to note here is that the guava cache does not perform cleanup and evict values asynchronously, that is, instantly after a value expires. Instead, it performs small amounts of maintenance during write operations, or during occasional read operations if writes are rare.\n\n\nCacheLoader\n\n\nstreamsCache\n is created with a \nCacheLoader\n that opens an \nFSDataOutputStream\n for a file which is not in the cache. The output stream is opened in either \nappend\n or \ncreate\n mode and the basic logic to determine this is explained by the simple diagram below.\n\n\n\n\nThis process gets complicated when fault-tolerance (writing to temporary files)  and rotation is added.\n\n\nFollowing are a few configuration items used for opening the streams:\n\n\n\n\nreplication\n: specifies the replication factor of the output files. \nDefault\n: \nfs.getDefaultReplication(new Path(filePath))\n\n\nfilePermission\n: specifies the permission of the output files. The permission is an octal number similar to that used by the Unix chmod command. \nDefault\n: 0777\n\n\n\n\nRemovalListener\n\n\nA \nGuava\n cache also allows specification of removal listener which can perform some operation when an entry is removed from the cache. Since \nstreamsCache\n is of limited size and also has time-based expiry enabled, it is imperative that when a stream is evicted from the cache it is closed properly. Therefore, we attach a removal listener to \nstreamsCache\n which closes the stream when it is evicted.\n\n\nsetup(OperatorContext context)\n\n\nDuring setup the following main tasks are performed:\n\n\n\n\nFileSystem instance is created.\n\n\nThe cache of streams is created.\n\n\nFiles are recovered (see Fault-tolerance section).\n\n\nStray part files are cleaned (see Automatic rotation section).\n\n\n\n\nprocessTuple(INPUT tuple)\n\n\nThe code snippet below highlights the basic steps of processing a tuple.\n\n\nprotected void processTuple(INPUT tuple)\n{  \n  //which file to write to is derived from the tuple.\n  String fileName = getFileName(tuple);  \n\n  //streamsCache is queried for the output stream. If the stream is already opened then it is returned immediately otherwise the cache loader creates one.\n  FilterOutputStream fsOutput = streamsCache.get(fileName).getFilterStream();\n\n  byte[] tupleBytes = getBytesForTuple(tuple);\n\n  fsOutput.write(tupleBytes);\n}\n\n\n\n\nendWindow()\n\n\nIt should be noted that while processing a tuple we do not flush the stream after every write. Since flushing is expensive it is done periodically for all the open streams in the operator's \nendWindow()\n.\n\n\nMap\nString, FSFilterStreamContext\n openStreams = streamsCache.asMap();\nfor (FSFilterStreamContext streamContext: openStreams.values()) {\n  ...\n  //this flushes the stream\n  streamContext.finalizeContext();\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nFSFilterStreamContext\n will be explained with compression and encryption.\n\n\nteardown()\n\n\nWhen any operator in a DAG fails then the application master invokes \nteardown()\n for that operator and its downstream operators. In \nAbstractFileOutputOperator\n we have a bunch of open streams in the cache and the operator (acting as HDFS client) holds leases for all the corresponding files. It is important to release these leases for clean re-deployment. Therefore, we try to close all the open streams in \nteardown()\n.\n\n\nAutomatic rotation\n\n\nIn a streaming application where data is being continuously processed, when this output operator is used, data will be continuously written to an output file. The users may want to be able to take the data from time to time to use it, copy it out of Hadoop or do some other processing. Having all the data in a single file makes it difficult as the user needs to keep track of how much data has been read from the file each time so that the same data is not read again. Also users may already have processes and scripts in place that work with full files and not partial data from a file.\n\n\nTo help solve these problems the operator supports creating many smaller files instead of writing to just one big file. Data is written to a file and when some condition is met the file is finalized and data is written to a new file. This is called file rotation. The user can determine when the file gets rotated. Each of these files is called a part file as they contain portion of the data.\n\n\nPart filename\n\n\nThe filename for a part file is formed by using the original file name and the part number. The part number starts from 0 and is incremented each time a new part file created. The default filename has the format, assuming origfile represents the original filename and partnum represents the part number,\n\n\norigfile.partnum\n\n\nThis naming scheme can be changed by the user. It can be done so by overriding the following method\n\n\nprotected String getPartFileName(String fileName, int part)\n\n\n\n\nThis method is passed the original filename and part number as arguments and should return the part filename.\n\n\nMechanisms\n\n\nThe user has a couple of ways to specify when a file gets rotated. First is based on size and second on time. In the first case the files are limited by size and in the second they are rotated by time.\n\n\nSize Based\n\n\nWith size based rotation the user specifies a size limit. Once the size of the currently file reaches this limit the file is rotated. The size limit can be specified by setting the following property\n\n\nmaxLength\n\n\nLike any other property this can be set in Java application code or in the property file.\n\n\nTime Based\n\n\nIn time based rotation user specifies a time interval. This interval is specified as number of application windows. The files are rotated periodically once the specified number of application windows have elapsed. Since the interval is application window based it is not always exactly constant time. The interval can be specified using the following property\n\n\nrotationWindows\n\n\nsetup(OperatorContext context)\n\n\nWhen an operator is being started there may be stray part files and they need to be cleaned up. One common scenario, when these could be present, is in the case of failure, where a node running the operator failed and a previous instance of the operator was killed. This cleanup and other initial processing for the part files happens in the operator setup. The following diagram describes this process\n\n\n\n\nFault-tolerance\n\n\nThere are two issues that should be addressed in order to make the operator fault-tolerant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operator flushes data to the filesystem every application window. This implies that after a failure when the operator is re-deployed and tuples of a window are replayed, then duplicate data will be saved to the files. This is handled by recording how much the operator has written to each file every window in a state that is checkpointed and truncating files back to the recovery checkpoint after re-deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile writing to HDFS, if the operator gets killed and didn't have the opportunity to close a file, then later when it is redeployed it will attempt to truncate/restore that file. Restoring a file may fail because the lease that the previous process (operator instance before failure) had acquired from namenode to write to a file may still linger and therefore there can be exceptions in acquiring the lease again by the new process (operator instance after failure). This is handled by always writing data to temporary files and renaming these files to actual files when a file is finalized (closed) for writing, that is, we are sure that no more data will be written to it. The relevant configuration item is:  \n\n\n\n\nalwaysWriteToTmp\n: enables/disables writing to a temporary file. \nDefault\n: true.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the complexity in the code comes from making this operator fault-tolerant.\n\n\nCheckpointed states needed for fault-tolerance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendOffsets\n: contains the size of each file as it is being updated by the operator. It helps the operator to restore a file during recovery in operator \nsetup(...)\n and is also used while loading a stream to find out if the operator has seen a file before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfileNameToTmpName\n: contains the name of the temporary file per actual file. It is needed because the name of a temporary file is random. They are named based on the timestamp when the stream is created. During recovery the operator needs to know the temp file which it was writing to and if it needs restoration then it creates a new temp file and updates this mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinalizedFiles\n: contains set of files which were requested to be finalized per window id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinalizedPart\n: contains the latest \npart\n of each file which was requested to be finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of \nfinalizedFiles\n and \nfinalizedPart\n are explained in detail under \nrequestFinalize(...)\n method.\n\n\nRecovering files\n\n\nWhen the operator is re-deployed, it checks in its \nsetup(...)\n method if the state of a file which it has seen before the failure is consistent with the file's state on the file system, that is, the size of the file on the file system should match the size in the \nendOffsets\n. When it doesn't the operator truncates the file.\n\n\nFor example, let's say the operator wrote 100 bytes to test1.txt by the end of window 10. It wrote another 20 bytes by the end of window 12 but failed in window 13. When the operator gets re-deployed it is restored with window 10 (recovery checkpoint) state. In the previous run, by the end of window 10, the size of file on the filesystem was 100 bytes but now it is 120 bytes. Tuples for windows 11 and 12 are going to be replayed. Therefore, in order to avoid writing duplicates to test1.txt, the operator truncates the file to 100 bytes (size at the end of window 10) discarding the last 20 bytes.\n\n\nrequestFinalize(String fileName)\n\n\nWhen the operator is always writing to temporary files (in order to avoid HDFS Lease exceptions), then it is necessary to rename the temporary files to the actual files once it has been determined that the files are closed. This is referred to as \nfinalization\n of files and the method allows the user code to specify when a file is ready for finalization.\n\n\nIn this method, the requested file (or in the case of rotation \n all the file parts including the latest open part which have not yet been requested for finalization) are registered for finalization. Registration is basically adding the file names to \nfinalizedFiles\n state and updating \nfinalizedPart\n.\n\n\nThe process of \nfinalization\n of all the files which were requested till the window \nw\n is deferred till window \nw\n is committed. This is because until a window is committed it can be replayed after a failure which means that a file can be open for writing even after it was requested for finalization.\n\n\nWhen rotation is enabled, part files as and when they get completed are requested for finalization. However, when rotation is not enabled user code needs to invoke this method as the knowledge that when a file is closed is unknown to this abstract operator.",

This is handled by recording how much the operator has written to each file every window in a state that is checkpointed and truncating files back to the recovery checkpoint after re-deployment.    While writing to HDFS, if the operator gets killed and didn't have the opportunity to close a file, then later when it is redeployed it will attempt to truncate/restore that file. Restoring a file may fail because the lease that the previous process (operator instance before failure) had acquired from namenode to write to a file may still linger and therefore there can be exceptions in acquiring the lease again by the new process (operator instance after failure).

The interaction between the operator and the scanner is depicted in the diagram below.\n\n\n\n\nExample application\n\n\nThis is a simple sub-dag that demonstrates how FileSplitterInput can be plugged into an application.\n\n\n\n\nSplitter is the input operator here that sends block metadata to the downstream BlockReader.\n\n\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration configuration)\n  {\n    FileSplitterInput input = dag.addOperator(\nInput\n, new FileSplitterInput());\n    FSSliceReader reader = dag.addOperator(\nBlock Reader\n, new FSSliceReader());\n    ...\n    dag.addStream(\nblock-metadata\n, input.blocksMetadataOutput, reader.blocksMetadataInput);\n    ...\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\nPorts\n\n\nSince it is an input operator there are no input ports and output ports are inherited from AbstractFileSplitter.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\nscanner\n: the component that scans directories asynchronously.

The basic implementation of TimeBasedDirectoryScanner can be customized by users.  \n\n\n\n\na. \nfiles\n: comma separated list of directories to scan.  \n\n\nb. \nrecursive\n: flag that controls whether the directories should be scanned recursively.  \n\n\nc. \nscanIntervalMillis\n: interval specified in milliseconds after which another scan iteration is triggered.  \n\n\nd. \nfilePatternRegularExp\n: regular expression for accepted file names.  \n\n\ne. \ntrigger\n: a flag that triggers a scan iteration instantly. If the scanner thread is idling then it will initiate a scan immediately otherwise if a scan is in progress, then the new iteration will be triggered immediately after the completion of current one.\n2. \nidempotentStorageManager\n: by default FileSplitterInput is idempotent. \nIdempotency ensures that the operator will process the same set of files/blocks in a window if it has seen that window previously, i.e., before a failure. For example, let's say the operator completed window 10 and failed somewhere between window 11. If the operator gets restored at window 10 then it will process the same file/block again in window 10 which it did in the previous run before the failure. Idempotency is important but comes with higher cost because at the end of each window the operator needs to persist some state with respect to that window. Therefore, if one doesn't care about idempotency then they can set this property to be an instance of \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.IdempotentStorageManager.NoopIdempotentStorageManager\n.\n\n\nHandling of split records\n\n\nSplitting of files to create tasks for downstream operator needs to be a simple operation that doesn't consume a lot of resources and is fast. This is why the file splitter doesn't open files to read. The downside of that is if the file contains records then a record may split across adjacent blocks. Handling of this is left to the downstream operator.\n\n\nWe have created Block readers in Apex-malhar library that handle line splits efficiently.

            "text": "HDHT\n\n\nSome applications need to compute values based not only on current event flow but also on historical data. HDHT provides a simple interface to store\nand access historical data in an operator. HDHT is an embedded state store with key value interface on top of the Hadoop file system. It is fully integrated into the Apache Apex operator model and provides persistent storage with exactly-once guarantee.\n\n\nThe programming model of a key-value store or hash table can be applied to a wide range of common use cases. Within most streaming applications, ingested events or computed data already carry the key that can be used for storage and retrieval. Many operations performed during computation require key based access. HDHT provides an embedded key value store for the application. The advantage of HDHT over other key value stores in streaming applications are\n\n\n\n\nEmbedded, Hadoop native solution. Does not require install/manage of other services.\n\n\nIntegrates with Apex check-pointing mechanism to provide exactly once guarantee.\n\n\n\n\nThis document provides overview of HDHT and instructions for using HDHT in an operator for storing\nand retrieving state of the operator.\n\n\nConcepts\n\n\nWrite Ahead Log\n\n\nEach tuple written to HDHT is written to Write Ahead Log (WAL) first. The WAL is used\nto recover in-memory state and provide exactly once processing after failure of an operator. HDHT\nstores WAL on HDFS to prevent data loss during node failure.\n\n\nUncommitted Cache\n\n\nUncommitted cache is in-memory key value store. Initially updates are written to this memory store, to avoid disk I/Os on every update. When data in Uncommitted cached reaches a configured limit, it is written on the disk. It avoids frequent data flushes and small file creation by writing data in bulk from the cache to disk thereby also improving throughput.\n\n\nData Files\n\n\nHDHT flushes memory to persisted storage periodically. The data is kept indexed for efficient retrieval of given key. HDHT supports multiple data file backends. Default backend used is DTFile, which is a modified version of Hadoop TFile with block cache for speedy lookups.\nAvailable backends are\n- \nTFile\n: Files are written in hadoop \nTfile\n format\n- \nDTFile\n: Files are written in TFile format; during lookup HDHT maintains a block cache to reduce disk I/Os.\n- \nHFile\n : Files are written in HBase format.\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nMetadata file keeps information about data files. Each data file record contains start key and name of the file. Metadata file also contains WAL recovery information, which is used during recovery after failure.\n\n\nPartition (HDHT Bucket)\n\n\nBy default, when the operator is partitioned, the partitioning is reflected by HDHT in the filesystem by using a separate directory for each operator partition. Each directory is accessed only by the associated operator partition. Each partition has its own WAL and metadata file. Each\nHDHT partition is identified by bucketKey, which is also the name of the subdirectory used for\nstoring data for the partition.\n\n\nInterface\n\n\nHDHT supports two basic operations \nget\n and \nput\n, they are wrapped by interfaces HDHT.Writer, HDHT.Reader and an abstract implementation is provided by the HDHTReader and HDHTWriter classes.\n\n\nOperations supported by HDHT are.\n\n\nbyte[] get(long bucketKey, Slice key) throws IOException;\nvoid put(long bucketKey, Slice key, byte[] value) throws IOException;\nbyte[] getUncommitted(long bucketKey, Slice key);\n\n\n\n\nAll methods takes bucketKey as the first argument. The bucketKey is used as a partition key within HDHT.\n\n\n\n\nput\n store data in HDHT. The data written is written to the WAL first and then stored in uncommitted cache.\nAfter enough dirty data is accumulated in cache or enough time has elapsed from last flush, this cache is flushed to the data files.\n\n\ngetUncommitted\n does a lookup in uncommitted cache. Uncommitted cache is in-memory key value store.\n\n\nget\n does a lookup in persisted storage file and return the data. \nNote\n \nget\n does not\n return data from uncommitted cache.\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nPlease refer to \nHDHT Blog\n\nfor the architecture of HDHT.\n\n\nCodec\n\n\nHDHT provides an abstract implementation \nAbstractSinglePortHDHTWriter\n, which uses a user defined codec for serialization and de-serialization.\n\n\npublic interface HDHTCodec\nEVENT\n extends StreamCodec\nEVENT\n\n{\n  byte[] getKeyBytes(EVENT event);\n  byte[] getValueBytes(EVENT event);\n  EVENT fromKeyValue(Slice key, byte[] value);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt has following methods\n- \ngetKeyBytes\n Return key as a byte array from the event.\n- \ngetValueBytes\n Return value as a byte array from event.\n- \nfromKeyValue\n HDHT will use this function to deserialize key and value byte arrays to reconstruct the user event object.\n- \ngetPartition\n This method is inherited from StreamCodec, its return value is used to determine HDHT bucket where this event will be written. The same stream codec is used\n for partition of the input port which make sure that data for same event goes to a single partition\n of the operator.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nfileStore\n\n\nThis setting determines the format in which files are written.

This class support code for operator partitioning. Also it provides an input port with a default implementation of\nstoring value received on the port to the HDHT using the coded provided.\n\n\nFor this example we will use \nAbstractSinglePortHDHTWriter\n for the store, we need to\nimplement codec which is used by \nAbstractSinglePortHDHTWriter\n for serialization and deserialization. Following is\na simple serializer which serializes key and ignores the value part, as the input to the operator is only keys.\n\n\nImplement a Codec\n\n\n  public static class StringCodec extends KryoSerializableStreamCodec\nString\n implements HDHTCodec\nString\n {\n    @Override\n    public byte[] getKeyBytes(String s)\n    {\n      return s.getBytes();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public byte[] getValueBytes(String s)\n    {\n      return s.getBytes();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String fromKeyValue(Slice key, byte[] value)\n    {\n      return new String(key.buffer, key.offset, key.length);\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n\nThe store operator is implemented as shown below, we will need to provide an implementation of\n\ngetCodec\n, and override \nprocessEvent\n to change default behavior of storing data in HDHT\ndirectly.\n\n\npublic class HDHTWordCounter extends AbstractSinglePortHDHTWriter\nString\n\n{\n  public transient DefaultOutputPort\nPair\nString, Long\n out = new DefaultOutputPort\n();\n  private transient HashMap\nString, AtomicLong\n cache;\n\n  @Override\n  protected HDHTCodec\nString\n getCodec()\n  {\n    return new StringCodec();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected void processEvent(String word) throws IOException\n  {\n    AtomicLong count = cache.get(word);\n    if (count == null) {\n      count = new AtomicLong(0L);\n      cache.put(word, count);\n    }\n    count.incrementAndGet();\n  }\n\n  private void updateCount() throws IOException\n  {\n    for(Map.Entry\nString, AtomicLong\n entry : cache.entrySet()) {\n      String word = entry.getKey();\n      long prevCount = 0;\n      byte[] key = codec.getKeyBytes(word);\n      Slice keySlice = new Slice(key);\n      long bucketKey = getBucketKey(word);\n      /** First look for cached data */\n      byte[] value = getUncommitted(bucketKey, keySlice);\n      if (value == null) {\n        /** look into persisted data files */\n        value = get(bucketKey, keySlice);\n        if (value == null) {\n          value = ByteBuffer.allocate(8).putLong(0).array();\n        }\n      }\n\n      prevCount = ByteBuffer.wrap(value).getLong();\n\n      /** update count by taking new event into account */\n      prevCount += entry.getValue().get();\n\n      /** save computed result back to HDHT */\n      put(bucketKey, keySlice, ByteBuffer.wrap(value).putLong(prevCount).array());\n\n      /* emit updated counts on the output port */\n      out.emit(new Pair\n(word, prevCount));\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void beginWindow(long windowId)\n  {\n    super.beginWindow(windowId);\n    cache = new HashMap\n();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void endWindow()\n  {\n    try {\n      updateCount();\n      super.endWindow();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n\n      throw new RuntimeException(\nUnable to flush to HDHT\n);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSample Application.\n\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation(name=\nHDHTWordCount\n)\npublic class HDHTWordCountApp implements StreamingApplication\n{\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration configuration)\n  {\n    AbstractFileInputOperator.FileLineInputOperator gen = dag.addOperator(\nReader\n, new AbstractFileInputOperator.FileLineInputOperator());\n    gen.setDirectory(\n/home/data\n);\n\n    WordSplitter splitter = dag.addOperator(\nSplitter\n, new WordSplitter());\n\n    HDHTWordCounter store = dag.addOperator(\nStore\n, new HDHTWordCounter());\n    ConsoleOutputOperator console = dag.addOperator(\nConsole\n, new ConsoleOutputOperator());\n\n    TFileImpl.DTFileImpl hdsFile = new TFileImpl.DTFileImpl();\n    hdsFile.setBasePath(\nWALBenchMarkDir\n);\n    store.setFileStore(hdsFile);\n\n    dag.addStream(\nlines\n, gen.output, splitter.input);\n    dag.addStream(\ns1\n, splitter.output, store.input);\n    dag.addStream(\ns2\n, store.out, console.input);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPerformance tuning\n\n\nEffect of frequent WAL flushes.\n\n\nHDHT stores Write Ahead Log (WAL) on HDFS, WAL is flushed at end of every application window. Operator will be blocked till WAL is persisted on the disks. This flush will add additional delay\nto the operator. To avoid frequent delay we can reduce the frequency of flush by increasing APPLICATION_WINDOW_SIZE.\n\n\nApplication Level Cache\n\n\nMaintain a cache to avoid frequent serialization and de-serialization of events while accessing HDHT. For example in the provided example the operator keeps computed counts till the endWindow and flushes the data to HDHT at end of the application window. If duplicate keys are seen within an application window we will save on serialization and de-serialization time.\n\n\nKey design\n\n\nHDHT gives best performance if keys are monotonically increasing, In this case\nHDHT does not have to overwrite existing files, which avoids expensive disk I/O thus yielding\noptimal performance. Overwriting existing file is costly operation, as it involves reading file data\nto memory and applying new changes from committed cached which falls within the key range of file, and\nwriting back changes to disk again. If you are storing time series data in HDHT, it is best to\nuse timestamp as the leading field in the key.\n\n\nFor keys which are not monotonically increasing, key design should be such that hot\nkeys falls in small number of files. For example, suppose each file size is \nS\n bytes and flush is\ntriggered every \nT\n seconds, and HDFS write bandwidth per container is \nB\n bytes per second, in this case we can sustain the write throughput, if keys processed within 30 seconds span at most \n(T / (S/B))\n files. \n\n\nIf S, T and B are 128MB, 30 seconds, and 40MB respectively, this expression evaluates to 10, so if your keys span more than 10 files with 30 seconds, the write cannot be sustained.\n\n\nFile Backend\n\n\nPrefer \nDTFile\n backend implementation over \nTFile\n backend implementation if you are going to issue frequent \nget\n operations. DTFile backend caches file blocks\nin memory which reduces disk I/O during cache hit.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Partitioning is not supported yet.\n\n\nWrite to same bucket from multiple operator is not supported. The default implementation use derives bucketKey based on number of operator partitions and hashcode of the event. If user chooses to use different bucketKey he needs to make sure that a single bucketKey is handled by only one operator partition.",

Kafka Input Operator is a fault-tolerant and scalable Malhar Operator.\n\n\nWhy is it needed ?\n\n\nKafka is a pull-based and distributed publish subscribe messaging system, topics are partitioned and replicated across\nnodes. Kafka input operator is needed when you want to read data from multiple\npartitions of a Kafka topic in parallel in an Apex application.\n\n\nAbstractKafkaInputOperator\n\n\nThis is the abstract implementation that serves as base class for consuming messages from Kafka messaging system. This class doesn\u2019t have any ports.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaxTuplesPerWindow\n\n\nControls the maximum number of messages emitted in each streaming window from this operator. Minimum value is 1. Default value = MAX_VALUE \n\n\n\n\n\n\nidempotentStorageManager\n\n\nThis is an instance of IdempotentStorageManager. Idempotency ensures that the operator will process the same set of messages in a window before and after a failure. For example, let's say the operator completed window 10 and failed somewhere between window 11. If the operator gets restored at window 10 then it will process the same messages again in window 10 which it did in the previous run before the failure. Idempotency is important but comes with higher cost because at the end of each window the operator needs to persist some state with respect to that window. Default Value = com.datatorrent.lib.io.IdempotentStorageManager.\nNoopIdempotentStorageManager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrategy\n\n\nOperator supports two types of partitioning strategies, ONE_TO_ONE and ONE_TO_MANY.\n\n\nONE_TO_ONE: If this is enabled, the AppMaster creates one input operator instance per Kafka topic partition. So the number of Kafka topic partitions equals the number of operator instances.\n\n\nONE_TO_MANY: The AppMaster creates K = min(initialPartitionCount, N) Kafka input operator instances where N is the number of Kafka topic partitions. If K is less than N, the remaining topic partitions are assigned to the K operator instances in round-robin fashion. If K is less than initialPartitionCount, the AppMaster creates one input operator instance per Kafka topic partition. For example, if initialPartitionCount = 5 and number of Kafka partitions(N) = 2 then AppMaster creates 2 Kafka input operator instances.\nDefault Value = ONE_TO_ONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmsgRateUpperBound\n\n\nMaximum messages upper bound. Operator repartitions when the \nmsgProcessedPS\n exceeds this bound. \nmsgProcessedPS\n is the average number of messages processed per second by this operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbyteRateUpperBound\n\n\nMaximum bytes upper bound. Operator repartitions when the \nbytesPS\n exceeds this bound. \nbytesPS\n is the average number of bytes processed per second by this operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noffsetManager\n\n\nThis is an optional parameter that is useful when the application restarts or start at specific offsets (offsets are explained below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepartitionInterval\n\n\nInterval specified in milliseconds.

Default Value = Instance of SimpleKafkaConsumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Methods\n\n\nvoid emitTuple(Message message): Abstract method that emits tuples\nextracted from Kafka message.\n\n\nKafkaConsumer\n\n\nThis is an abstract implementation of Kafka consumer. It sends the fetch\nrequests to the leading brokers of Kafka partitions. For each request,\nit receives the set of messages and stores them into the buffer which is\nArrayBlockingQueue. SimpleKafkaConsumer\u00a0which extends\nKafkaConsumer and serves the functionality of Simple Consumer API and\nHighLevelKafkaConsumer which extends KafkaConsumer and \u00a0serves the\nfunctionality of High Level Consumer API.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nThis operator referred the Kafka Consumer API of version\n0.8.1.1. So, this operator will work with any 0.8.x and 0.7.x version of Apache Kafka.\n\n\nConfiguration Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzookeeper\n\n\nString\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies the zookeeper quorum of Kafka clusters that you want to consume messages from. zookeeper \u00a0is a string in the form of hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3 \u00a0where hostname1,hostname2,hostname3 are hosts and port1,port2,port3 are ports of zookeeper server. \u00a0If the topic name is the same across the Kafka clusters and want to consume data from these clusters, then configure the zookeeper as follows: c1::hs1:p1,hs2:p2,hs3:p3;c2::hs4:p4,hs5:p5,c3::hs6:p6\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nc1,c2,c3 indicates the cluster names, hs1,hs2,hs3,hs4,hs5,hs6 are zookeeper hosts and p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6 are corresponding ports. Here, cluster name is optional in case of single cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncacheSize\n\n\nint\n\n\n1024\n\n\nMaximum of buffered messages hold in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic\n\n\nString\n\n\ndefault_topic\n\n\nIndicates the name of the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialOffset\n\n\nString\n\n\nlatest\n\n\nIndicates the type of offset i.e, \u201cearliest or latest\u201d. If initialOffset is \u201clatest\u201d, then the operator consumes messages from latest point of Kafka queue. If initialOffset is \u201cearliest\u201d, then the operator consumes messages starting from message queue. This can be overridden by OffsetManager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Methods\n\n\n\n\nvoid commitOffset(): Commit the offsets at checkpoint.\n\n\nMap \nKafkaPartition, Long\n getCurrentOffsets(): Return the current\n    offset status.\n\n\nresetPartitionsAndOffset(Set \nKafkaPartition\n partitionIds,\n    Map \nKafkaPartition, Long\n startOffset): Reset the partitions with\n    partitionIds and offsets with startOffset.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Parameters\u00a0for SimpleKafkaConsumer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbufferSize\n\n\nint\n\n\n1 MB\n\n\nSpecifies the maximum total size of messages for each fetch request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadataRefreshInterval\n\n\nint\n\n\n30 Seconds\n\n\nInterval in between refresh the metadata change(broker change) in milliseconds.

A value of -1 disables this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadataRefreshRetryLimit\n\n\nint\n\n\n-1\n\n\nSpecifies the maximum brokers' metadata refresh retry limit. -1 means unlimited retry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsetManager\n\n\nThis is an interface for offset management and is useful when consuming data\nfrom specified offsets. Updates the offsets for all the Kafka partitions\nperiodically. Below is the code snippet:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\npublic interface OffsetManager\n{\n  public Map\nKafkaPartition, Long\n loadInitialOffsets();\n  public void updateOffsets(Map\nKafkaPartition, Long\n offsetsOfPartitions);\n}\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Methods\n\n\nMap \nKafkaPartition, Long\n loadInitialOffsets(): Specifies the initial offset for consuming messages; called at the activation stage.\n\n\nupdateOffsets(Map \nKafkaPartition, Long\n offsetsOfPartitions): \u00a0This\nmethod is called at every repartitionCheckInterval to update offsets.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\nThe logical instance of the KafkaInputOperator acts as the Partitioner\nas well as a StatsListener. This is because the\nAbstractKafkaInputOperator implements both the\ncom.datatorrent.api.Partitioner and com.datatorrent.api.StatsListener\ninterfaces and provides an implementation of definePartitions(...) and\nprocessStats(...) which makes it auto-scalable.\n\n\nResponse processStats(BatchedOperatorStats stats)\n\n\nThe application master invokes this method on the logical instance with\nthe stats (tuplesProcessedPS, bytesPS, etc.) of each partition.\nRe-partitioning happens based on whether any new Kafka partitions added for\nthe topic or bytesPS and msgPS cross their respective upper bounds.\n\n\nDefinePartitions\n\n\nBased on the repartitionRequired field of the Response object which is\nreturned by processStats(...) method, the application master invokes\ndefinePartitions(...) on the logical instance which is also the\npartitioner instance. Dynamic partition can be disabled by setting the\nparameter repartitionInterval value to a negative value.\n\n\nAbstractSinglePortKafkaInputOperator\n\n\nThis class extends AbstractKafkaInputOperator and having single output\nport, will emit the messages through this port.\n\n\nPorts\n\n\noutputPort \nT\n: Tuples extracted from Kafka messages are emitted through\nthis port.\n\n\nAbstract Methods\n\n\nT getTuple(Message msg) : Converts the Kafka message to tuple.\n\n\nConcrete Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafkaSinglePortStringInputOperator :\nThis class extends AbstractSinglePortKafkaInputOperator and getTuple() method extracts string from Kafka message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafkaSinglePortByteArrayInputOperator:\nThis class extends AbstractSinglePortKafkaInputOperator and getTuple() method extracts byte array from Kafka message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Example\n\n\nThis section builds an Apex application using Kafka input operator.\nBelow is the code snippet:\n\n\n@ApplicationAnnotation(name = \nKafkaApp\n)\npublic class ExampleKafkaApplication implements StreamingApplication\n{\n@Override\npublic void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration entries)\n{\n  KafkaSinglePortByteArrayInputOperator input =  dag.addOperator(\nMessageReader\n, new KafkaSinglePortByteArrayInputOperator());\n\n  ConsoleOutputOperator output = dag.addOperator(\nOutput\n, new ConsoleOutputOperator());\n\n  dag.addStream(\nMessageData\n, input.outputPort, output.input);\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the configuration for using the earliest offset, \u201ctest\u201d as the topic name and\n\u201clocalhost:2181\u201d as the zookeeper forum:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.MessageReader.prop.initialOffset\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\nearliest\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\nproperty\n\n\nname\ndt.operator.MessageReader.prop.topic\n/name\n\n\nvalue\ntest\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\nproperty\n\n\nname\ndt.operator.MessageReader.prop.zookeeper\n/nam\n\n\nvalue\nlocalhost:2181\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that \nMessageReader\n is the string passed as the first argument to the\n\naddOperator()\n call.

Idempotency ensures that the operator will process the same set of messages in a window before and after a failure. For example, let's say the operator completed window 10 and failed somewhere between window 11. If the operator gets restored at window 10 then it will process the same messages again in window 10 which it did in the previous run before the failure.

We will then explore the basic building blocks of the App Data Framework, and the data schemas that Apache Apex and DataTorrent RTS support.\n\n\nThis document assumes that the reader has the basic knowledge of Apache Apex.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nA Simple Example\n\n\nIn Apache Apex Malhar, the Twitter example demonstrates the usage of the App Data Framework. The application calculates top 10 hashtags mentioned in tweets in the last 5 minutes across a 1% random tweet sampling on a rolling window basis.\n\n\nIn DataTorrent RTS, you can create a dashboard for this Twitter application that has a bar chart widget with the current top hashtags in Twitter constantly updated:\n\n\n\n\nThe topology of the Twitter example looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSnapshotServer\n operator (along with a Query Operator embedded in it) and the \nQueryResult\n operator enable the latest Twitter top hashtags to be visualizable in the widget. \n\n\nWe will explain them in the following sections.\n\n\nThe code of this Twitter example with App Data support is available \nhere\n\n\nA More Complicated Example\n\n\nIn DataTorrent RTS, the Sales example demonstrates a more complicated usage of the App Data Framework. The application generates random sales events, which has dimension keys of sales channels, region and products. Then it aggregates tax, sales amount and discount across all the key combinations.\n\n\n\n\nThe topology of the Sales example looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Twitter example, the \nStore\n operator along with the Query Operator embedded in it, and the \nQueryResult\n operator enable the data to be queried and be delivered to the widget for visualization.\n\n\nThe code of this Sales example is available \nhere\n\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\n\nAt a very high level, this is the architecture diagram for the App Data Framework. We will explain each of the components.\n\n\n\n\nApp Data Source\n\n\nEach App Data Source is a queryable unit, and it is represented by three operators in your application. It is possible to have multiple such App Data Sources in one application.\n\n\n\n\nData Source\n\n\nThe Data Source Operator that runs in an Apex application that processes the queries from the Query Operator and gives back the results. In the Twitter example, it is the \nSnapshot Server\n operator. The Java class of this operator is \ncom.datatorrent.lib.appdata.snapshot.AppDataSnapshotServerMap\n in Apex Malhar. In the Sales example, it is the \nStore\n operator. The Java class of this operator is \ncom.datatorrent.contrib.dimensions.AppDataSingleSchemaDimensionStoreHDHT\n, which is provided by DataTorrent RTS.\n\n\nQuery Operator\n\n\nThe Query Operator runs embedded in the Data Source Operator, listens for incoming queries from the Message Bus and hands it over to the Data Source Operator. Note that since the Query Operator is embedded within the Data Source Operator, it will not be visible in the DAG view in \ndtManage\n. In both the Twitter and the Sales examples, the Java class that implements the Query Operator is \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.PubSubWebSocketAppDataQuery\n.\n\n\nResult Operator\n\n\nThe Result Operator runs in an Apex application that publishes the results from the Data Source Operator to the Message Bus. In the Twitter example, it is the \nQueryResult\n operator. The Java class of this operator in both the Twitter and Sales examples is \ncom.datatorrent.lib.io.PubSubWebSocketAppDataResult\n.\n\n\nMessage Bus\n\n\nBecause the operators can run in any node in the cluster, a Message Bus with a pub-sub mechanism is used for delivery for both the queries and the results. This mechanism requires that the caller sends the query message to a topic that the Query Operator listens to, and the Result Operator sends the query result message passed from the Data Source Operator to a different topic that the caller listens to. Typically, the caller is a web browser.\n\n\nIn DataTorrent RTS, this mechanism is provided by \ndtGateway\n. It uses WebSocket to achieve this so that the queries can be made and the results can be processed directly by a web browser. \n\n\nReferring back to the architecture diagram, the web browser, the Query Operator and the Result Operator all connect to dtGateway via WebSocket, with a pub-sub protocol on top of it.\n\n\nSchemas\n\n\nEach App Data Source must provide a schema that describes what is a valid data query and what is a valid data response, so that the caller knows how to query and how to interpret the response from the App Data Sources. We will describe two schemas that underlie the Twitter example and the Sales example.\n\n\nUI Widgets\n\n\nIn order to allow the end users to visualize the result data in a web browser, we need web-based UI widgets that take user input and send the queries and display the results according to the App Data Sources\u2019 schemas. In DataTorrent RTS, we have a number of UI widgets built in. We will also describe how a user can write their own custom widgets.\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\n\nApp Data Source\n\n\nAs described in the overview, an App Data Source consists of three operators: Data Source, Query and Result.\n\n\nThe Result Operator must implement this interface in \ncom.datatorrent.common.experimental.AppData\n:\n\n\ninterface ConnectionInfoProvider \n{\n  String getAppDataUrl();\n  String getTopic();\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Query Operator, which is embedded in the Data Store Operator, must implement this interface in \ncom.datatorrent.common.experimental.AppData\n:\n\n\ninterface EmbeddableQueryInfoProvider\nQUERY_TYPE\n extends Operator, ConnectionInfoProvider, Operator.ActivationListener\nOperatorContext\n\n{\n  DefaultOutputPort\nQUERY_TYPE\n getOutputPort();\n\n  void enableEmbeddedMode();\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe port that is returned by the embedded Query Operator\u2019s \ngetOutputPort()\n method will be connected to the input port of the Data Source Operator that is annotated with the marker annotation \ncom.datatorrent.common.experimental.AppData.QueryPort\n.\n\n\nOn the DAG level, the Result Operator needs to connect to an output port of the Data Source Operator that is annotated with the marker annotation \ncom.datatorrent.common.experimental.AppData.ResultPort\n. \n\n\nWith this setup, the Data Source, along with the query topic and the result topic, will be discoverable by STRAM. STRAM will return the information to the caller via its REST API.\n\n\nBelow is the App Data Source discovery information returned by the \n/ws/v2/applications/{appid}\n REST call from dtGateway for the Twitter example:\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \nappDataSources\n: [\n    {\n      \nname\n: \nSnapshotServer.queryResult\n,\n      \noperatorName\n: \nSnapshotServer\n,\n      \nportName\n: \nqueryResult\n,\n      \nquery\n: {\n        \noperatorName\n: \nSnapshotServer.query\n,\n        \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryDemo\n,\n        \nurl\n: \npubsub\n\n      },\n      \nresult\n: {\n        \nappendQIDToTopic\n: true,\n        \noperatorName\n: \nQueryResult\n,\n        \u201ctopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo\n,\n        \nurl\n: \npubsub\n\n      }\n    }, ... ]\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nname\n field contains the name of the Data Source, and it has the following form: \ndataSourceOperatorName\n.\nresultPortName\n.\n\n\nThe \noperatorName\n field is the Data Source operator name.\n\n\nThe \nportName\n field is the result port name of the Data Source operator.\n\n\nThe \nquery\n field describes the query mechanism, including the topic. \n\n\nThe \nresult\n field describes the result mechanism, including the topic and whether the query ID will be appended to the topic. Setting \nappendQIDToTopic\n to true increases the granularity of topics so that callers can receive results only for their queries. If the cost of creating such a large number of topics is high, it can be set to false; callers then will need to filter the results suitably.\n\n\nMessage Bus\n\n\ndtGateway has a WebSocket service that provides the pubsub mechanism required by the Message Bus. The URL is \nws://{dtGatewayAddress}/pubsub\n. You can publish data with a topic by sending a WebSocket message like this:\n\n\n{\n  \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cpublish\u201d, \u201ctopic\u201d: \u201c{topic}\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d: {data}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntopic\n field is the topic name, and the \ndata\n field is the payload and can be any JSON object.\n\n\nAll client that have subscribed to the topic will receive the data. The format is:\n\n\n{\n  \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cdata\u201d, \u201ctopic\u201d: \u201c{topic}\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d: {data}\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd to subscribe to the topic, the client must send this message to dtGateway using WebSocket:\n\n\n{\n  \u201ctype\u201d: \u201csubscribe\u201d, \u201ctopic\u201d: \u201c{topic}\u201d\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can try it with dtGateway using a web browser with the help of a WebSocket client (e.g. \u201cSimple WebSocket Client\u201d extension in Google Chrome).\n\n\nNote that dtGateway does not keep the history of the messages. \n\n\nInteraction between Data Source and Web Browser\n\n\nThe web browser, the Query Operator and the Result Operator all connect to dtGateway via the Message Bus. The following describes the step-by-step interaction among them on a high level:\n\n\n\n\nThe UI widget in the browser subscribes to the result topic\n\n\nThe UI widget sends a schema query to the query topic.\n\n\nThe Data Source Operator gets the schema query and sends the schema result to the result topic, which the UI widget receives.\n\n\nThe UI widget in the browser subscribes to the result topic\n\n\nThe UI widget sends a data query\n\n\nThe Data Source Operator gets the data query and processes it and sends back the data result to the result topic.\n\n\nThe UI widget receives the data result and renders it.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the actual messages being exchanged for the Twitter example.\n\n\nSnapshot Schema\n\n\nThe Snapshot Schema serves a simple snapshot of tabular data, which is typically constantly being updated and is used in the Twitter example. We will describe the Snapshot schema as we look at the messages.\n\n\nStep 1: Browser sends Schema Response Subscribe\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \nsubscribe\n,\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.20716154835833223\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn preparation for a Schema Query, the browser first subscribes to the result topic (with the query ID appended) to get the Schema Result back. In this case, the browser generates a random string, \u201c0.20716154835833223\u201d for the query ID, and appends the query ID to the result topic that it is subscribing to. \n\n\nStep 2: Browser sends Schema Query\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \npublish\n,\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryDemo\n,\n  \ndata\n: {\n    \nid\n: 0.20716154835833223,\n    \ntype\n: \nschemaQuery\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe browser sends a message with type, \nschemaQuery\n. This is the query that asks for the schema type and schema data. \n\n\nStep 3: Data Source sends Schema Response\n\n\n{\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.20716154835833223\n,\n  \ndata\n: {\n    \nid\n: \n0.20716154835833223\n,\n    \ntype\n: \nschemaResult\n,\n    \ndata\n: [\n      {\n        \nvalues\n: [\n          {\n            \nname\n: \nhashtag\n,\n            \ntype\n: \nstring\n\n          },\n          {\n            \nname\n: \ncount\n,\n            \ntype\n: \ninteger\n\n          }\n        ],\n        \nschemaType\n: \nsnapshot\n,\n        \nschemaVersion\n: \n1.0\n\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \ntype\n: \ndata\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Source sends back the \nschemaResult\n, which contains the response to \nschemaQuery\n, which contains schema type and schema data. In this case, schemaType is snapshot and schemaVersion is 1.0, and the available fields in the data are \u201chashtag\u201d, which is a string, and \u201ccount\u201d, which is an integer.\n\n\nStep 4: Browser sends Data Result Subscribe\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \nsubscribe\n,\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.6760250790172551\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous subscribe message, the browser subscribes to the result topic to get the response for the \ndataQuery\n that the browser is going to issue.\n\n\nStep 5: Browser sends Data Query Request\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \npublish\n,\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryDemo\n,\n  \ndata\n: {\n    \nid\n: 0.6760250790172551,\n    \ntype\n: \ndataQuery\n,\n    \ndata\n: {\n      \nfields\n: [\n        \nhashtag\n,\n        \ncount\n\n      ]\n    },\n    \ncountdown\n: 30,\n    \nincompleteResultOK\n: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe browser sends the \ndataQuery\n message that asks for actual data.\n\n\nThe \ncountdown\n field expects an optional integer value. It tells the Data Source that the Data Source should return results once for subsequent {countdown} application windows. In this example, the value is 30. That means the Data Source should execute this query 30 times, once for each application window for the next 30 application windows.\n\n\nThe \nincompleteResultOK\n field is an optional boolean value default to be false. If the value is true, the Data Source should return results as soon as they are available even if they are partial results. This is useful when {countdown} is greater than 1 and the Data Source could take a long time to return the complete result set and if it is desirable for the caller to receive the results as soon as possible. If this value is false, Data Source should return the complete result set to the caller\n\n\nWithin the \ndata\n field, the \nfields\n field tells the Data Source what fields to return in the result.\n\n\nStep 6: Data Source sends Data Response\n\n\n{\n  \ntopic\n: \nTwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.6760250790172551\n,\n  \ndata\n: {\n    \nid\n: \n0.6760250790172551\n,\n    \ntype\n: \ndataResult\n,\n    \ndata\n: [\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1398\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n\uc0ac\uc124\ud1a0\ud1a0\ucd94\ucc9c\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1415\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \nTopDance\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1498\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \nisola\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1521\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \nRT\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u5168\u54e1\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30fc\u3059\u308b\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1728\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n4\u670819\u65e5\u306f\u897f\u6728\u91ce\u771f\u59eb\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n1787\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n\ub124\uc784\ub4dc\uc0ac\ub2e4\ub9ac\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n2079\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \nALDUBActing101\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n2280\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n\u5730\u9707\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n2712\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n\u897f\u6728\u91ce\u771f\u59eb\u751f\u8a95\u796d2016\n\n      },\n      {\n        \ncount\n: \n2714\n,\n        \nhashtag\n: \n\u0634\u0639\u064a\u0628_\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0621_\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0647\n\n      }\n    ],\n    \ncountdown\n: \n29\n\n  },\n  \ntype\n: \ndata\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Source sends the \ndataResult\n message in response to the \ndataQuery\n. In this case, it contains a list of (hashtag, count) sets in the \ndata\n field.\n\n\nIf the \ncountdown\n field of the \ndataQuery\n is non-zero, there will be multiple such messages that correspond to one \ndataQuery\n message.  The \ncountdown\n field in the \ndataResult\n message decrements every time it sends a result.  When it counts down to zero, the query has expired and the client must send another \ndataQuery\n message to receive further updates.\n\n\nIn this case, because the countdown value is 30 in the \ndataQuery\n, the Data Source will keep sending the latest data set for the next 29 application windows following this initial response.\n\n\nFor more information about the operators behind this Snapshot Schema, please refer to \nthis document\n.\n\n\nDimensions Schema\n\n\nThe Dimensions Schema is an extension of the Snapshot Schema with the notion of time and key dimensions. It is supported in DataTorrent RTS. \n\n\nWe will look at the message exchange in the Sales example.\n\n\nStep 1: Browser sends Schema Response Subscribe\n\n\n{\ntype\n:\nsubscribe\n,\ntopic\n:\nSalesQueryResultDemo.0.676153457723558\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to the Snapshot example we saw earlier.\n\n\nStep 2: Browser sends Schema Query\n\n\n{\n   \ntype\n:\npublish\n,\n   \ntopic\n:\nSalesQueryDemo\n,\n   \ndata\n:{\n      \nid\n: 0.22710832906886935,\n      \ntype\n:\nschemaQuery\n\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this is similar to the Snapshot example we saw earlier.\n\n\nStep 3: Data Source sends Schema Response.\n\n\n{\n   \ntopic\n:\nSalesQueryResultDemo.0.22710832906886935\n,\n   \ndata\n:{\n      \nid\n:\n0.22710832906886935\n,\n      \ntype\n:\nschemaResult\n,\n      \ndata\n:[\n         {\n            \nschemaType\n:\ndimensions\n,\n            \nschemaVersion\n:\n1.0\n,\n            \ntime\n:{\n               \nbuckets\n:[\n1m\n,\n1h\n,\n1d\n,\n5m\n],\n               \nslidingAggregateSupported\n:true\n            },\n            \nkeys\n:[\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\nchannel\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\nstring\n,\n                  \nenumValues\n:[\nMobile\n, \nOnline\n, \nStore\n]\n               },\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\nregion\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\nstring\n,\n                  \nenumValues\n:[\nAtlanta\n, \nBoston\n,\nChicago\n,\nCleveland\n,\nDallas\n,\n                     \nMinneapolis\n,\nNew York\n,\nPhiladelphia\n,\nSan Francisco\n,\nSt. Louis\n]\n               },\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\nproduct\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\nstring\n,\n                  \nenumValues\n:[\nLaptops\n,\nPrinters\n,\nRouters\n,\nSmart Phones\n,\nTablets\n]\n               }\n            ],\n            \nvalues\n:[\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\ntax:SUM\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\ndouble\n\n               },\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\nsales:SUM\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\ndouble\n\n               },\n               {\n                  \nname\n:\ndiscount:SUM\n,\n                  \ntype\n:\ndouble\n\n               }\n            ],\n            \ndimensions\n:[\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nchannel\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nregion\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nproduct\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nregion\n,\n                     \nchannel\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nproduct\n,\n                     \nchannel\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nproduct\n,\n                     \nregion\n\n                  ]\n               },\n               {\n                  \ncombination\n:[\n                     \nproduct\n,\n                     \nregion\n,\n                     \nchannel\n\n                  ]\n               }\n            ]\n         }\n      ]\n   },\n   \ntype\n:\ndata\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the Snapshot Schema, this is considerably more complex. The response to the query describes the keys and aggregates that are provided by the data source. The basic components of the schema are the following:\n\n\ntimebuckets\n: These are the time buckets over which aggregations are computed. For example, 1d (one day), 1h (one hour), 1m (one minute), 1s (one second).\n\n\nkeys\n: These are the search parameters you need to provide when you do a query. The keys have an enumValues. This is an optional section which contains all possible values of a key. This section may be updated by the back end if new key values are encountered.\n\n\nvalues\n: These are the results which are returned by a query. Notice that the values are of the form (name):(aggregation). The first portion of the value name describes what is being aggregated. The second portion of the value name describes the aggregation being used.\n\n\ncombinations\n: This describes the valid combinations of keys that can be specified when doing a query.\n\n\nStep 4: Browser sends Data Result Subscribe\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \nsubscribe\n,\n  \ntopic\n: \nSalesQueryResultDemo.0.3180227109696716\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Browser sends Data Query Request\n\n\nNow that the valid combinations, keys, values, and timebuckets are known, we can issue a query using them. \n\n\n{\n   \ntype\n:\npublish\n,\n   \ntopic\n:\nSalesQueryDemo\n,\n   \ndata\n:{\n      \nid\n: \n0.3180227109696716\n,\n      \ntype\n:\ndataQuery\n,\n      \ndata\n:{\n         \ntime\n:{\n            \nlatestNumBuckets\n:10,\n            \nbucket\n:\n1m\n\n         },\n         \nincompleteResultOK\n:true,\n         \nkeys\n:{\n\n         },\n         \nfields\n:[\n            \ntime\n,\n            \nchannel\n,\n            \nregion\n,\n            \nproduct\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n\n         ]\n      },\n      \ncountdown\n:29,\n      \nincompleteResultOK\n:true\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\ntime\n: This specifies which time buckets to query. In this case the most recent 10 one minute time buckets are queried. The example above illustrates how to query the last N timebuckets, but it is also possible to do history queries by specifying a time section like the following:\n\n\n        \ntime\n:{\n         \nbucket\n:\n1m\n,\n         \nfrom\n:1460765563547,\n         \nto\n:1460767363547\n       }\n\n\n\n\nThis time section specifies a historical query starting at the \u201cfrom\u201d unix timestamp (inclusive) up until the \u201cto\u201d timestamp (inclusive).\n\n\nkeys\n: These are the search parameters. This section can be empty to query global aggregations. If there are specific key combinations you want to search for you can do this:\n\n\n\u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: \u201cAtlanta\u201d\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to specify a key with a list like the following:\n\n\n\u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: [ \u201cAtlanta\u201d, \u201cDallas\u201d ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will query all the data with a \nchannel\n value of \u201cMobile\u201d and a \nregion\n value of \u201cAtlanta\u201d OR \u201cDallas\u201d. It is also possible to specify a key with an empty array like the following:\n\n\n\u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: []\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will query all the data with a \nchannel\n value of \u201cMobile\u201d and ANY value of \nregion\n.\nNote that this is different from not specifying the \nregion\n value at all, in which case, the aggregated value of all regions will be returned. This is similar to the difference between the SQL queries of \nSELECT SUM(sales) WHERE channel=\u2019Mobile\u2019\n (for the case of not specifying \nregion\n) and \nSELECT SUM(sales), region WHERE channel=\u2019Mobile\u2019 GROUP BY region\n (for the case of \nregion\n being an empty array).\n\n\nfields\n: This specifies what data to include in the query result. If the field \ntime\n is included, then a timestamp is included for each data point. Similarly the keys can also be specified as fields with the results. Lastly aggregated values can also be specified as fields to be returned in results.\n\n\nStep 6: Data Source sends Data Response.\n\n\nAfter a query is issued, results are periodically returned:\n\n\n{\n   \ntopic\n:\nSalesQueryResultDemo.0.3180227109696716\n,\n   \ndata\n: {\n      \nid\n:\n0.3180227109696716\n,\n      \ntype\n:\ndataResult\n,\n      \ndata\n:[\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771580000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n78363.47\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n922988.9199999997\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n69135.71999999999\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771640000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n142011.85\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n1672677.0099999998\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n125287.46999999999\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771700000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n139069.53999999998\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n1638011.5399999998\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n122692.48999999999\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771760000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n80699.90000000001\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n950502.3500000003\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n71196.95000000001\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771820000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n35914.69\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n423017.9000000001\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n69339.05000000002\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771880000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n106977.84999999998\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n1260017.5600000003\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n629939.14\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460771940000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n253243.50000000003\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n2982796.9300000006\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n1491234.3599999999\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460772000000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n161384.77999999997\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n1900857.2300000002\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n950325.01\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460772060000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n125283.99000000002\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n1475625.3600000003\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n737730.77\n\n         },\n         {\n            \ntime\n:\n1460772120000\n,\n            \nregion\n:\nBoston\n,\n            \nproduct\n:\nALL\n,\n            \nchannel\n:\nMobile\n,\n            \ntax:SUM\n:\n58684.59\n,\n            \nsales:SUM\n:\n691200.9299999999\n,\n            \ndiscount:SUM\n:\n345562.2700000001\n\n         }\n      ],\n      \ncountdown\n:\n297\n\n   },\n   \ntype\n:\ndata\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see each result represents a time bucket with the corresponding values for the fields. If the ANY value (with an empty list) query is specified for a key you will see multiple results for the same time bucket, but each result will have different values for the keys.\n\n\nDetailed documentation of the dimensions operators can be found here: \nhttp://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/dimensions_computation/\n\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\n\nSchema Keys\n\n\nAlthough in most cases, a Data Source has one fixed schema, it is sometimes necessary for a Data Source to support multiple schemas. This is useful if the schemas are dynamically created depending on the incoming data to the Data Source Operator.\n\n\nSchema Key is the feature we added to the App Data Framework for this purpose. If the Data Source has multiple schemas, the \nschemaResult\n will contain a list of schemas with the corresponding schema keys in the \ncontext\n field:\n\n\n{\n  \u201cid\u201d: \u201c{client_generated_id}\u201d,\n  \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cschemaResult\u201d,\n  \u201cdata\u201d: [ \n    {\n      \u201ccontext\u201d: {\n        \u201cschemaKeys\u201d: {\n          \u201c{key1}\u201d: \u201c{value1}\u201d,\n          \u201c{key2}\u201d: \u201c{value2}\u201d, ...\n         }\n      },\n      {rest of the schema}\n    }, ...\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd if the \nschemaResult\n returns multiple schemas, all \ndataQuery\n messages must include the schema keys:\n\n\n{\n   \u201cid\u201d: \u201c{client_generated_id}\u201d,\n   \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cdataQuery\u201d, \n   \u201cdata\u201d: {\n     \u201ccontext\u201d: {\n       \u201cschemaKeys\u201d { //optional\n    \u201c{keyName1}\u201d: \u201c{keyValue1}\u201d,\n    \u201c{keyName2}\u201d: \u201c{keyValue2}\u201d \n       }\n     }\n     {rest of the query}\n   }\n   \u201ccountdown\u201d: \u201c{countdown}\u201d,\n   \u201cincompleteResultOK\u201d: true/false\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is supported by the DimensionsStore operator and is being used by the App Data Tracker.\n\n\nDimensions Schema: Additional Values for Combinations\n\n\nFor the Dimensions Schema supported by the DimensionsStore operator, there can be more complex schema specifications which have results for values only for certain combinations. This is the schema for yet another example about aggregation of advertisement data in the DataTorrent RTS example repository.\n\n\n{\n   \ntopic\n:\nAdsQueryGenericResultDemo.0.08170037856325507\n,\n

Step 1: Browser sends Schema Response Subscribe  {\n   type :  subscribe ,\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.20716154835833223 \n}  In preparation for a Schema Query, the browser first subscribes to the result topic (with the query ID appended) to get the Schema Result back. In this case, the browser generates a random string, \u201c0.20716154835833223\u201d for the query ID, and appends the query ID to the result topic that it is subscribing to.   Step 2: Browser sends Schema Query  {\n   type :  publish ,\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryDemo ,\n   data : {\n     id : 0.20716154835833223,\n     type :  schemaQuery \n  }\n}  The browser sends a message with type,  schemaQuery . This is the query that asks for the schema type and schema data.   Step 3: Data Source sends Schema Response  {\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.20716154835833223 ,\n   data : {\n     id :  0.20716154835833223 ,\n     type :  schemaResult ,\n     data : [\n      {\n         values : [\n          {\n             name :  hashtag ,\n             type :  string \n          },\n          {\n             name :  count ,\n             type :  integer \n          }\n        ],\n         schemaType :  snapshot ,\n         schemaVersion :  1.0 \n      }\n    ]\n  },\n   type :  data \n}  The Data Source sends back the  schemaResult , which contains the response to  schemaQuery , which contains schema type and schema data. In this case, schemaType is snapshot and schemaVersion is 1.0, and the available fields in the data are \u201chashtag\u201d, which is a string, and \u201ccount\u201d, which is an integer.  Step 4: Browser sends Data Result Subscribe  {\n   type :  subscribe ,\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.6760250790172551 \n}  Similar to the previous subscribe message, the browser subscribes to the result topic to get the response for the  dataQuery  that the browser is going to issue.  Step 5: Browser sends Data Query Request  {\n   type :  publish ,\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryDemo ,\n   data : {\n     id : 0.6760250790172551,\n     type :  dataQuery ,\n     data : {\n       fields : [\n         hashtag ,\n         count \n      ]\n    },\n     countdown : 30,\n     incompleteResultOK : true\n  }\n}  The browser sends the  dataQuery  message that asks for actual data.  The  countdown  field expects an optional integer value. It tells the Data Source that the Data Source should return results once for subsequent {countdown} application windows. In this example, the value is 30. That means the Data Source should execute this query 30 times, once for each application window for the next 30 application windows.  The  incompleteResultOK  field is an optional boolean value default to be false. If the value is true, the Data Source should return results as soon as they are available even if they are partial results. This is useful when {countdown} is greater than 1 and the Data Source could take a long time to return the complete result set and if it is desirable for the caller to receive the results as soon as possible. If this value is false, Data Source should return the complete result set to the caller  Within the  data  field, the  fields  field tells the Data Source what fields to return in the result.  Step 6: Data Source sends Data Response  {\n   topic :  TwitterHashtagQueryResultDemo.0.6760250790172551 ,\n   data : {\n     id :  0.6760250790172551 ,\n     type :  dataResult ,\n     data : [\n      {\n         count :  1398 ,\n         hashtag :  \uc0ac\uc124\ud1a0\ud1a0\ucd94\ucc9c\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \n      },\n      {\n         count :  1415 ,\n         hashtag :  TopDance \n      },\n      {\n         count :  1498 ,\n         hashtag :  isola \n      },\n      {\n         count :  1521 ,\n         hashtag :  RT\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u5168\u54e1\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30fc\u3059\u308b \n      },\n      {\n         count :  1728 ,\n         hashtag :  4\u670819\u65e5\u306f\u897f\u6728\u91ce\u771f\u59eb\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u65e5 \n      },\n      {\n         count :  1787 ,\n         hashtag :  \ub124\uc784\ub4dc\uc0ac\ub2e4\ub9ac \n      },\n      {\n         count :  2079 ,\n         hashtag :  ALDUBActing101 \n      },\n      {\n         count :  2280 ,\n         hashtag :  \u5730\u9707 \n      },\n      {\n         count :  2712 ,\n         hashtag :  \u897f\u6728\u91ce\u771f\u59eb\u751f\u8a95\u796d2016 \n      },\n      {\n         count :  2714 ,\n         hashtag :  \u0634\u0639\u064a\u0628_\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0621_\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0647 \n      }\n    ],\n     countdown :  29 \n  },\n   type :  data \n}  The Data Source sends the  dataResult  message in response to the  dataQuery . In this case, it contains a list of (hashtag, count) sets in the  data  field.  If the  countdown  field of the  dataQuery  is non-zero, there will be multiple such messages that correspond to one  dataQuery  message.  The  countdown  field in the  dataResult  message decrements every time it sends a result.  When it counts down to zero, the query has expired and the client must send another  dataQuery  message to receive further updates.  In this case, because the countdown value is 30 in the  dataQuery , the Data Source will keep sending the latest data set for the next 29 application windows following this initial response.

The response to the query describes the keys and aggregates that are provided by the data source. The basic components of the schema are the following:  timebuckets : These are the time buckets over which aggregations are computed. For example, 1d (one day), 1h (one hour), 1m (one minute), 1s (one second).  keys : These are the search parameters you need to provide when you do a query. The keys have an enumValues. This is an optional section which contains all possible values of a key. This section may be updated by the back end if new key values are encountered.  values : These are the results which are returned by a query. Notice that the values are of the form (name):(aggregation). The first portion of the value name describes what is being aggregated. The second portion of the value name describes the aggregation being used.  combinations : This describes the valid combinations of keys that can be specified when doing a query.  Step 4: Browser sends Data Result Subscribe  {\n   type :  subscribe ,\n   topic :  SalesQueryResultDemo.0.3180227109696716 \n}  Step 5: Browser sends Data Query Request  Now that the valid combinations, keys, values, and timebuckets are known, we can issue a query using them.   {\n    type : publish ,\n    topic : SalesQueryDemo ,\n    data :{\n       id :  0.3180227109696716 ,\n       type : dataQuery ,\n       data :{\n          time :{\n             latestNumBuckets :10,\n             bucket : 1m \n         },\n          incompleteResultOK :true,\n          keys :{\n\n         },\n          fields :[\n             time ,\n             channel ,\n             region ,\n             product ,\n             tax:SUM ,\n             sales:SUM ,\n             discount:SUM \n         ]\n      },\n       countdown :29,\n       incompleteResultOK :true\n   }\n}  time : This specifies which time buckets to query. In this case the most recent 10 one minute time buckets are queried. The example above illustrates how to query the last N timebuckets, but it is also possible to do history queries by specifying a time section like the following:           time :{\n          bucket : 1m ,\n          from :1460765563547,\n          to :1460767363547\n       }  This time section specifies a historical query starting at the \u201cfrom\u201d unix timestamp (inclusive) up until the \u201cto\u201d timestamp (inclusive).  keys : These are the search parameters. This section can be empty to query global aggregations. If there are specific key combinations you want to search for you can do this:  \u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: \u201cAtlanta\u201d\n}  It is possible to specify a key with a list like the following:  \u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: [ \u201cAtlanta\u201d, \u201cDallas\u201d ]\n}  This will query all the data with a  channel  value of \u201cMobile\u201d and a  region  value of \u201cAtlanta\u201d OR \u201cDallas\u201d. It is also possible to specify a key with an empty array like the following:  \u201ckey\u201d: {\n  \u201cchannel\u201d: \u201cMobile\u201d\n  \u201cregion\u201d: []\n}  This will query all the data with a  channel  value of \u201cMobile\u201d and ANY value of  region .\nNote that this is different from not specifying the  region  value at all, in which case, the aggregated value of all regions will be returned. This is similar to the difference between the SQL queries of  SELECT SUM(sales) WHERE channel=\u2019Mobile\u2019  (for the case of not specifying  region ) and  SELECT SUM(sales), region WHERE channel=\u2019Mobile\u2019 GROUP BY region  (for the case of  region  being an empty array).  fields : This specifies what data to include in the query result. If the field  time  is included, then a timestamp is included for each data point. Similarly the keys can also be specified as fields with the results. Lastly aggregated values can also be specified as fields to be returned in results.  Step 6: Data Source sends Data Response.  After a query is issued, results are periodically returned:  {\n    topic : SalesQueryResultDemo.0.3180227109696716 ,\n    data : {\n       id : 0.3180227109696716 ,\n       type : dataResult ,\n       data :[\n         {\n             time : 1460771580000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 78363.47 ,\n             sales:SUM : 922988.9199999997 ,\n             discount:SUM : 69135.71999999999 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771640000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 142011.85 ,\n             sales:SUM : 1672677.0099999998 ,\n             discount:SUM : 125287.46999999999 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771700000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 139069.53999999998 ,\n             sales:SUM : 1638011.5399999998 ,\n             discount:SUM : 122692.48999999999 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771760000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 80699.90000000001 ,\n             sales:SUM : 950502.3500000003 ,\n             discount:SUM : 71196.95000000001 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771820000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 35914.69 ,\n             sales:SUM : 423017.9000000001 ,\n             discount:SUM : 69339.05000000002 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771880000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 106977.84999999998 ,\n             sales:SUM : 1260017.5600000003 ,\n             discount:SUM : 629939.14 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460771940000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 253243.50000000003 ,\n             sales:SUM : 2982796.9300000006 ,\n             discount:SUM : 1491234.3599999999 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460772000000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 161384.77999999997 ,\n             sales:SUM : 1900857.2300000002 ,\n             discount:SUM : 950325.01 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460772060000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 125283.99000000002 ,\n             sales:SUM : 1475625.3600000003 ,\n             discount:SUM : 737730.77 \n         },\n         {\n             time : 1460772120000 ,\n             region : Boston ,\n             product : ALL ,\n             channel : Mobile ,\n             tax:SUM : 58684.59 ,\n             sales:SUM : 691200.9299999999 ,\n             discount:SUM : 345562.2700000001 \n         }\n      ],\n       countdown : 297 \n   },\n    type : data \n}  As you can see each result represents a time bucket with the corresponding values for the fields. If the ANY value (with an empty list) query is specified for a key you will see multiple results for the same time bucket, but each result will have different values for the keys.

            "text": "App Data Tracker\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nApp Data Tracker, called ADT from now on for conciseness, is a system Apex application that utilizes App Data Framework for collecting and aggregating stats and auto-metrics of user Apex applications.\n\n\nStats\n are pre-defined measurements that tracks the health and performance of an application. There are 2 types of stats for each Apex application.\n\n Application stats - these include stats at the application level. For example - \nplannedContainers\n, \nnumOperators\n, \nfailedContainers\n, \ntotalTuplesProcessed\n, etc.\n\n Operator stats - these include stats of each operator in an application. Example of per operator stats are - \ntotalTuplesProcessed\n, \ntotalTuplesEmitted\n, \ncpuPercentageMA\n, etc.\n\n\nAutoMetrics\n are custom measurements that an operator developer can define for their operator. If an operator having auto-metrics is integrated to an application, then these auto-metrics become eligible\nto be collected by ADT for aggregation. AutoMetrics are explained in detail \nhere\n.\n\n\nInteraction between ADT and user Apex Applications\n\n\nAfter ADT has been enabled, applications will push stats and metrics to dtGateway. In this scenario, dtGateway serves as a message bus. ADT acts as a\nsubscriber to this message bus. The diagram below depicts the message flow among user Apex applications, dtGateway and ADT.\n\n\n\n\nLaunching ADT\n\n\nADT can be automatically launched by dtGateway if the dt-site.xml that is used by the dtGateway has the following properties:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.appDataTracker.enable\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ntrue\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.appDataTracker.transport\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.metric.AutoMetricBuiltInTransport:AppDataTrackerFeed\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.attr.METRICS_TRANSPORT\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.common.metric.AutoMetricBuiltInTransport:AppDataTrackerFeed\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: ADT will be shown running in dtManage as a \u201csystem app\u201d.  It will show up if the \u201cshow system apps\u201d button is pressed.\n\n\nADT Topology\n\n\n\n\nThe input operator in ADT is a web-socket input operator which listens to the topic \nAppDataTrackerFeed\n. This is the topic which the\napplication masters of the user applications are publishing to.\n\n\nOnce the messages enter ADT, they are processed for aggregation and stored in HDHT.\n\n\nAggregations\n\n\nADT aggregates only \nMetrics\n by time. \nStats\n - application or operator level represent cumulative values and therefore are not time-aggregated.\n\n\nBy default, the time buckets ADT aggregates upon are one minute, one hour and one day. It can be overridden by changing the operator attribute \nMETRICS_DIMENSIONS_SCHEME\n.\n\n\nAlso by default, ADT performs all these aggregations : SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT, FIRST, LAST on all number metrics.  You can also override by changing the same operator attribute \nMETRICS_DIMENSIONS_SCHEME\n, provided the custom aggregator is known to ADT.  (See next section)\n\n\nCustom Aggregator in ADT\n\n\nCustom aggregators allow you to do your own custom computation on statistics generated by any of your applications. In order to write a Custom aggregator the implementations of the\nfollowing methods is needed:\n\n\n\n\nCombining new inputs with the current aggregation\n\n\nCombining two aggregations together into one aggregation\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider the case where we want to perform the following rolling average:\n\n\nY_n = (1/2) * X_n + (1/4) * X_n-1 + (1/8) * X_n-2 + (1/16) * X_n-3 +...\n\n\nThis aggregation could be performed by the following Custom Aggregator:\n\n\n@Name(\nIIRAVG\n)\npublic class AggregatorIIRAVG extends AbstractIncrementalAggregator\n{\n  ...\n\n  private void aggregateHelper(DimensionsEvent dest, DimensionsEvent src)\n  {\n    double[] destVals = dest.getAggregates().getFieldsDouble();\n    double[] srcVals = src.getAggregates().getFieldsDouble();\n\n    for (int index = 0; index \n destLongs.length; index++) {\n      destVals[index] = .5 * destVals[index] + .5 * srcVals[index];\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void aggregate(Aggregate dest, InputEvent src)\n  {\n    //Aggregate a current aggregation with a new input\n    aggregateHelper(dest, src);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void aggregate(Aggregate destAgg, Aggregate srcAgg)\n  {\n    //Combine two existing aggregations together\n    aggregateHelper(destAgg, srcAgg);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery of Custom Aggregators\n\n\nADT searches for custom aggregator jars under the following directories statically before launching:\n\n\n\n\n{dt_installation_dir}/plugin/aggregators\n\n\n{user_home_dir}/.dt/plugin/aggregators\n\n\n\n\nIt uses reflection to find all the classes that extend from \nIncrementalAggregator\n and \nOTFAggregator\n in these jars and registers them with the name provided by \n@Name\n annotation (or class name when \n@Name\n is absent).\n\n\nUsing \nMETRICS_DIMENSIONS_SCHEME\n\n\nHere is a sample code snippet on how you can make use of \nMETRICS_DIMENSIONS_SCHEME\n to set your own time buckets and your own set of aggregators for certain \nAutoMetric\ns performed by the ADT in your application.\n\n\n  @Override\n  public void populateDAG(DAG dag, Configuration configuration)\n  {\n    ...\n    LineReceiver lineReceiver = dag.addOperator(\nLineReceiver\n, new LineReceiver());\n    ...\n    AutoMetric.DimensionsScheme dimensionsScheme = new AutoMetric.DimensionsScheme()\n    {\n      String[] timeBuckets = new String[] { \n1s\n, \n1m\n, \n1h\n };\n      String[] lengthAggregators = new String[] { \nIIRAVG\n, \nSUM\n };\n      String[] countAggregators = new String[] { \nSUM\n };\n\n      /* Setting the aggregation time bucket to be one second, one minute and one hour */\n      @Override\n      public String[] getTimeBuckets()\n      {\n        return timeBuckets;\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public String[] getDimensionAggregationsFor(String logicalMetricName)\n      {\n        if (\nlength\n.equals(logicalMetricName)) {\n          return lengthAggregators;\n        } else if (\ncount\n.equals(logicalMetricName)) {\n          return countAggregators;\n        } else {\n          return null; // use default\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    dag.setAttribute(lineReceiver, OperatorContext.METRICS_DIMENSIONS_SCHEME, dimensionsScheme);\n    ...\n  }\n\n\n\n\nDashboards\n\n\nWith ADT enabled, you can visualize the AutoMetrics and system metrics in the Dashboards within dtManage.   Refer back to the \ndiagram\n, dtGateway relays queries and query results to and from ADT.  In this way, dtManage sends queries and receives results from ADT via dtGateway and uses the results to let the user visualize the data.\n\n\nClick on the visualize button in dtManage's application page.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the dashboard for the AutoMetrics and the system metrics.\n\n\n\n\nThe left widget shows the AutoMetrics of \nline\n and \ncount\n for the \nLineReceiver\n operator.  The right widget shows the system metrics.\n\n\nThe Dashboards have some simple builtin widgets to visualize the data.  Line charts and bar charts are some examples.\nUsers will be able to implement their own widgets to visualize their data.",

You can use the applications as they are, or use the templates as a starting point to develop custom applications.\n\n\n\n\nLaunch\n\n\nThe Launch screen lists all of the imported and uploaded packages and their applications. Applications can be launched and active instances viewed.\n\n\n\n\nLaunching Apps\n\n\nTo launch an app in an App Package, click on the launch button to the far right of the list. A dialog box will appear with several options: \n\n\n\n\nSpecify a name for the running app\n\n  The console will pre-populate this field with an appropriate name, but you can specify your own name. Make sure it is unique among all the applications running in the Hadoop cluster of your DataTorrent installation.\n\n\nSpecify launch properties\n\n  In addition to choosing a config file, you may also directly specify properties in the launch pop-up by selecting this option. Any required properties will automatically show up in this section and require input. Note that there are several helpful functions when specifying custom properties:\n\n\nadd\n - App Packages can have custom properties applied at launch time to override existing properties.\n\n\nadd default properties\n - App Packages can also have default properties. This function will add the default properties to the list, making it easy for you to override the defaults. This button can be found clicking on the \nadd\n button's submenu.\n  If any properties were added, the option to save the properties as a Configuration Package is activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse configuration file\n\n  App Package config files are xml files that contain \nproperties\n that get interpreted and used for launching an application. To choose one, enable the check box and choose the config file you want to use for launch.\n\n\nUse configuration package\n\n  App Packages with a separate associated Configuration Package can be selected here. The Configuration Package will launch with its own custom properties.\n\n\nSpecify the \nscheduler queue\n\n  This input allows you to specify which queue you want the application to be launched under. The default behavior depends on your Hadoop installation, but typically will be \nroot.[USER_NAME]\n.\n\n\nEnable \nGarbage Collection logging\n\n  Checking this box enables GC logging by including the \n-Xloggc:\nLOG_DIR\n/gc.log -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps\n JVM options for all the containers of the application. This GC logging in turn enables garbage collection widgets described later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n For more information about config files and custom properties, see the \nApplication Packages Guide\n\n\n\n\nVisualize\n\n\nSee the \ndtDashboard\n page.\n\n\nMonitor\n\n\nThe Monitor section of the Console can be used to monitor, troubleshoot, and manage running application instances.\n\n\nCluster Overview\n\n\nThe Cluster Overview page shows overall cluster statistics as well as a list of running DataTorrent applications.\n\n\n\n\nThe cluster statistics include some performance statistics and memory usage information. As for the application list, there are two options to take note of: \nended apps\n and \nsystem apps\n. The first option will include all ended applications that are still in the resource manager history. The second option will include system apps, which are apps like the App Data Tracker that are developed by DataTorrent and used to add functionality to your DataTorrent cluster.\n\n\nInstance Page\n\n\nTo get to an application instance page, click on either the app name or the app id in the list of running applications.\n\n\n\n\nAll sections and subsections of the instance page currently use a dashboard/widget system. The controls for this system are located near the top of the screen, below the breadcrumbs:\n\n\n\n\nThere are tool tips to help you understand how to work with dashboards and widgets. For most users, the default dashboard configurations (\nlogical\n, \nphysical\n, \nphysical-dag-view\n, \nmetric-view\n, \nattempts\n) will suffice. The following is a list of widgets available on an app instance page:\n\n\nApplication Overview Widget\n\n\nAll the default dashboard tabs have this widget. It contains basic information regarding the app plus a few controls. To end a running application, use either the \u201cshutdown\u201d or \u201ckill\u201d buttons in this widget:\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cshutdown\u201d function tries to gracefully stop the application, while \u201ckill\u201d forces the application to end. In either case, you will need to confirm your action.\n\n\nYou can also use the \nset logging level\n button on this widget to specify what logging level gets written to the dt.log files. \n\n\n\n\nYou will then be presented with a dialog where you can specify either fully-qualified class names or package identifiers with wildcards:\n\n\n\n\nStram Events Widget\n\n\nEach application has a stream of notable events that can be viewed with the StrAM Events widget:\n\n\n\n\nSome events have additional information attached to it, which can be viewed by clicking the \"i\" icon in the list:\n\n\n\n\nLogical DAG Widget\n\n\nThis widget visualizes the logical plan of the application being viewed:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can cycle through various metrics aggregated by logical operator. In the screenshot above, processed tuples per second and emitted tuples per second are shown. \n\n\n\n\nPro tip:\n Hold the alt/option key while using your mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out on the DAG.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical DAG Widget\n\n\nThis is similar to the Logical DAG Widget, except it shows the fully deployed \"physical\" operators. Depending on the partitioning of your application, this could be significantly more complex than the Logical DAG view.\n\n\n\n\nSame-colored physical operators in this widget indicates that these operators are in the same container.\n\n\nLogical Operators List Widget\n\n\nThis widget shows a list of logical operators in the application. This table, like others, has live updates, filtering, column ordering, stacked row sorting, and column resizing. \n\n\nOne nice feature specific to this widget is the ability to set the logging level for the Java class of a logical operator by selecting it in this list and using the provided dropdown, like so:\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Operators List Widget\n\n\nShows the physical operators in the application.\n\n\nContainers List Widget\n\n\nShows the containers in the application. From this widget you can: select a container and go to one of its logs, fetch non-running containers and view information about them, and even kill selected containers.\n\n\nLogical Streams List Widget\n\n\nShows a list of the streams in the application. There are also links to the logical operator pages for the sources and sinks of each stream.\n\n\nMetrics Chart\n\n\nShows various metrics of your application on a real-time line chart. Single-click a metric to toggle its visibility. Double-click a metric to toggle all other keys' visibility.\n\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) Chart by Heap\n\n\nThis chart shows a container's heap memory in use in KB (kilo-bytes) against time. The chart is constructed by plotting and extrapolating in-use heap memory obtained from events in the GC log file of a container which requires GC logging to be enabled as described in \nLaunching apps\n. The chart shown is for a single container that is selectable from the radio buttons shown at the top right corner of the widget. Each container in the radio buttons and the chart is color-coded with the same color. The containers included depend on the context of the widget:\n\n\n\n\nall application containers in the application view\n\n\nall the containers containing the physical partitions of a logical operator in the logical operator view\n\n\nthe single parent container of a physical operator in the physical operator view\n\n\nthe container itself in the selected container view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) Log Table\n\n\nThis table shows the garbage collection (GC) events for a group of containers. This table too requires GC logging to be enabled as described in \nLaunching apps\n. The containers included in the group depend on the context of the widget:\n\n\n\n\nall application containers in the application view\n\n\nall the containers containing the physical partitions of a logical operator in the logical operator view\n\n\nthe single parent container of a physical operator in the physical operator view\n\n\nthe container itself in the selected container view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) Chart by Duration\n\n\nThis discrete bar chart shows GC event duration in seconds against time for a group of containers. Each bar is of fixed-width but the height denotes the duration of the corresponding GC event. This chart too requires GC logging to be enabled as described in \nLaunching apps\n. One or more containers are selectable from the radio buttons shown at the top right corner of the widget. Each container in the radio buttons and the chart is color-coded with the same color. The containers included depend on the context of the widget:\n\n\n\n\nall application containers in the application view\n\n\nall the containers containing the physical partitions of a logical operator in the logical operator view\n\n\nthe single parent container of a physical operator in the physical operator view\n\n\nthe container itself in the selected container view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording and Viewing Sample Tuples\n\n\nThere is a mechanism called tuple recording that can be used to easily look at the content of tuples flowing through your application. To use this feature, select a physical operator from the Physical Operators List widget and click on the \u201crecord a sample\u201d button. This will bring up a modal window which you can then use to traverse the sample and look at the actual content of the tuple (converted to a JSON structure):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip:\n Select multiple tuples by holding down the shift key.\n\n\n\n\nViewing Logs\n\n\nAnother useful feature of the Console is the ability to view container logs of a given application. To do this, select a container from the Containers List widget (default location of this widget is in the \u201cphysical\u201d dashboard). Then click the logs dropdown and select the log you want to look at:\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are viewing a log file in the console, there are few tricks to traversing it. You can scroll to the top to fetch earlier content, scroll to the bottom for later content, \"tail\" the log to watch for real-time updates, grep for strings in the selected range or over the entire log, and click the \u201ceye\u201d icon to the far left of every line to go to that location of the log:\n\n\n\n\nDevelop\n\n\nApplication packages and application configurations can be viewed and managed in the Develop section. For more information about application packages visit the \nApplication Packages Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nApplication Packages\n\n\nTo access the application package listing, click on the \"Apps\" link from the Develop Tab index page. From here, you can perform several operations directly on application packages:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the app package\n\n\nDelete the app package\n\n\nCreate a new application in an application package via dtAssemble (requires enterprise license)\n\n\nLaunch applications in the app package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n If authentication is enabled, you may not be able to see others\u2019 app packages, depending on your permissions.\n\n\n\n\nApplication Package Page\n\n\nOnce you have uploaded or imported an App Package, clicking on the package name in the list will take you to the Application Package Page, where you can view all the package details.\n\n\n\n\nAside from various pieces of meta information (owner, DataTorrent version, required properties, etc), you will see a list of apps found in this package. \n\n\nViewing an Application\n\n\nAll DataTorrent applications are made up of operators that connect together via streams to form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To see a visualization of this DAG, click on the application name in the list of applications. In addition to the DAG, Package Properties and any Required Properties will be listed on this page.\n\n\n\n\nCreating apps with dtAssemble\n\n\nIf you have an Enterprise license, you will have access to the dtAssemble tool. Using this tool is outside the scope of this guide, but check out the \ndtAssemble guide\n.\n\n\nConfigure\n\n\nThe RTS configuration menu is accessed by the cog button on the top-right corner of the Console. Under the \nconfiguration\n section, there are links to various tools to help you configure and troubleshoot your DataTorrent installation. The available menu items may differ depending on your security settings.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n\n\nThis page shows the system configuration, provides a way to make system changes, and displays any known issues for the DataTorrent RTS installation.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you can perform the following actions from this page:\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Configuration - Set up SMTP to be able to send out email alerts and notifications.\n\n\nRestart the Gateway - This button can be used to restart the gateway when the Hadoop configuration or system properties have changed.\n\n\nUsage Reporting - If enabled, your DataTorrent installation will send various pieces of information such as bug reporting and usage statistics back to our servers.\n\n\nInstallation Wizard - Rerun the initial installation to reconfigure HDFS installation path and Hadoop executable.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Configuration\n\n\nBy default, your installation starts with no security enabled, which may be sufficient on a closed network with a limited set of users. However, it is recommended to use some form of authentication especially for production environments.\n\n\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS supports various authentication methods which can be enabled by following instructions in the \nAuthentication\n section.\n\n\nSystem Alerts\n\n\nSystem alerts can be configured to notify users through the Console and emails based on various system and application metrics.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \n+ create new alert\n button to create an alert.\n\n\n\n\nAn alert consists of\n\n\n\n\na condition (a JavaScript expression)\n\n\na list of recipient email addresses\n\n\na threshold value in milliseconds\n\n\na message, and\n\n\nan enabled/disabled flag\n\n\n\n\nThe gateway periodically (every 5 seconds) processes all enabled alerts by evaluating the condition. If the condition evaluates to \ntrue\n, the alert is said to be \"in effect\".\nIf the condition evaluates to \nfalse\n, the alert is said to be \"out\" (or \"out of effect\"). If the alert stays \"in effect\" for the duration specified as the threshold value,\nthen the alert is triggered and the gateway sends an \"in effect\" email message to all the recipient email addresses.\n\n\nIf a triggered alert goes \"out of effect\" then the gateway immediately sends an \"out of effect\" email message to all the recipient email addresses.\n\n\nThe alert condition is specified as a JavaScript expression which is evaluated in the context of something called \ntopics\n which are described \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe gateway also provides pre-defined alert \"templates\" that allow a user to create alerts for certain common conditions without having to write JavaScript expressions.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \"Predefined Conditions\" tab and select a template from the drop-down list. Depending on your selection, you will need to provide more values to be filled into the template.\nAs an example, for the \"Application Memory Usage\" template you need to provide the Application Name and Memory values as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can click on the \"Javascript Code\" tab to see the generated JavaScript expression that corresponds to your alert template selection and provided values as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can generate a test email to validate your alert by checking the \"Send Test Email\" check-box and clicking on the blue \"Test\" button. The test email is sent regardless of the true or false result\nof the JavaScript condition, if the evaluation has no errors provided SMTP is configured as described in the Alerts section.\n\n\nLicense Information\n\n\nUse the License Information page to view how much of your DataTorrent license capacity your cluster is consuming as well as what capabilities your license permits. You can also upload new license files here.\n\n\n\n\nUser Profile\n\n\nThe User Profile page displays information about the current user, including their username, the authentication scheme being used, and the roles that the current user has. In addition, users can perform the following actions:\n\n\n\n\nChange password \n\n\nChange the default home page\n\n\nChange the theme of the console\n\n\nRestore the default options of the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Management\n\n\nUse this page to manage users and roles of your DataTorrent cluster:\n\n\n\n\nAdd users\n\n\nChange users\u2019 roles\n\n\nChange users\u2019 password\n\n\nDelete users\n\n\nAdd roles\n\n\nEdit role permissions\n\n\nDelete roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n With most authentication schemes, the admin role cannot be deleted.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Wizard\n\n\nThe first time you open the Console, after installing DataTorrent RTS on your cluster, it will take you to the Installation Wizard. This walks you through the initial configuration of your DataTorrent installation, by confirming the following:\n\n\n\n\nLocation of the Hadoop executable\n\n\nDFS location where all the DataTorrent files are stored\n\n\nDataTorrent license\n\n\nSummary and review of any remaining configuration items\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, you can go back to the installation wizard from the Configuration Tab. It can help diagnose issues and reconfigure your cluster and gateway.\n\n\n\n\nWhen your Hadoop cluster has security enabled with Kerberos, there will be four additional controls in the installation wizard: \n\n\n\n\nKerberos Principal\n: The Kerberos principal (e.g. primary/instance@REALM) to use on behalf of the management console.\n\n\nKerberos Keytab\n: The location (path) of the Kerberos keytab file to use on the gateway node's local file system.\n\n\nYARN delegation token lifetime\n: If the value of the \nyarn.resourcemanager.delegation.token.max-lifetime\n property in your cluster configuration has been changed from the default, enter it here. Otherwise, leave this blank and the default will be assumed.\n\n\nNamenode delegation token lifetime\n: If the value of the \ndfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime\n property in your cluster configuration has been changed from the default, enter it here. Otherwise, leave this blank and the default will be assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The token lifetime values you enter will not actually set these values in your hadoop configuration, it is only meant to inform the DataTorrent platform of these values.",

Depending on your selection, you will need to provide more values to be filled into the template.\nAs an example, for the \"Application Memory Usage\" template you need to provide the Application Name and Memory values as shown below:   You can click on the \"Javascript Code\" tab to see the generated JavaScript expression that corresponds to your alert template selection and provided values as shown below:   You can generate a test email to validate your alert by checking the \"Send Test Email\" check-box and clicking on the blue \"Test\" button. The test email is sent regardless of the true or false result\nof the JavaScript condition, if the evaluation has no errors provided SMTP is configured as described in the Alerts section.",

Then click the \u201cadd new application\u201d button.\n\n\nDrag operators onto the canvas\n  Use the search field of the Operator Library panel on the left to find the operators that were found in your app package, then click and drag them out onto the \u201cApplication Canvas.\u201d\n\n\nConfigure the operators using the Operator Inspector\n  When the operator is selected, the bottom panel will have the Operator Inspector, where you will see some meta information about the operator as well as the interface to set initial values for operator properties and attributes.\n\n\nConnect the operators\u2019 ports to form streams between operators\n  Select a port by clicking on it. Ports that are compatible with the selected port will pulse green. Click and drag out a stream from one port and connect it with a compatible port of another operator.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Application Builder\n\n\nThe Application Builder contains three main parts: the Operator Library Navigator, the Canvas, and the Inspector:\n\n\n\n\nOperator Library Navigator\n\n\n\n\nUse this to quickly find and add operators that exist in the Application Package Jar. It groups operators by their Prepping Operators for the Application Builder\nsection). You can search for operators using the input field at the top, which will look at the operators\u2019 titles, descriptions, and keywords. Clicking on an operator will expand a window with more information regarding the operator.\n\n\nOnce you have found an operator you would like to add to your application canvas, simply click and drag it onto the canvas.\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nThe Application Canvas is the main area that you use to assemble applications with operators and streams. Specifically, you will be connecting output ports (shown as magenta) of some operators to input ports (shown as blue) of other operators. When you click on a port, other ports that are compatible with it will pulse green, indicating that a stream can connect the two. See the note on tuple types of ports in the Prepping Operators for the Application Builder\nsection.\n\n\n\n\nInspector\n\n\nThe Inspector is visible when an operator, a port, or a stream is selected on the canvas. It will look different depending on what is selected.\n\n\nOperator Inspector\n\n\n\n\nWhen an operator is selected on the canvas, you will see the Operator Inspector on the bottom panel. You will see the operator class name, the java package it is a part of, and a field with the name you have given to it. You will also be able to edit the initial values of the operator\u2019s properties. \n\n\nPort Inspector\n\n\n\n\nWhen a port is selected, you will see the Port Inspector on the bottom panel. Here you can see the name of the port, the tuple type that it emits (for an output port) or accepts (for an input port).\n\n\nStream Inspector\n\n\n\n\nThe stream inspector will appear when you have selected a stream in the canvas. You can use this to rename the stream or change the locality of the stream.\n\n\nPrepping Operators for the Application Builder\n\n\nThe way in which an operator shows up in the App Builder depends on how the operator is written in Java. In order to fully prep an operator so that it can be easily used in the App Builder, use the following guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nOperators must be a concrete class and must have a no-arg constructor\n  This is actually a requirement that extends beyond app builder, but is noted here because operators that are abstract or that do not have a no-arg constructor will not appear in the Operator Library panel in the current version.\n\n\n\n\nUse javadoc annotations in the comment block above the class declaration statement:\n  a.  @omitFromUI - Put this annotation if you do not want the operator to show up in the App Builder\n  b.  @category - The high-level category that this operator should reside in. The value you put here is arbitrary; it will be placed in (or create a new) dropdown in the Operator Library Navigator on the left of the App Builder. You can have multiple categories per operator.\n  c.  @tags - Space-separated list of \u201ctags\u201d; arbitrary strings of text that will be searchable via the Operator Library Navigator on the left of the App Builder. Tags work as filters. You can use them to enable search, project identification, etc.\n  d.  @required - This is a future annotation to denote whether a property is required.\n\n\n/**\n * This is an example description of the operator It will be \n * displayed in the app builder under the operator in the Operator \n * Library Navigator.\n * @category Algo\n * @tags math sigma average avg\n */\npublic class MyOperator extends BaseOperator { /* \u2026 */ }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery property's getter method should be preceded by a descriptive comment block that indicates what a property does, how to use it, common values, etc. This is not a must have, but very highly recommended\n\n\n/**\n* This is an example description of a property on an operator class.\n* It will be displayed in the app builder under the property name.\n* It is ok to make this long because the UI will only show the first\n* sentence or so and allow the user to expand/collapse the rest.\n*/\npublic String getMyProperty() { /* \u2026 */ }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilize the @useSchema doclet annotation above properties\u2019 getter in order to mark a property\u2019s or subproperty\u2019s.  \n\n\n\n\nWhen a property's type is not a primitive, wrapper class for a primitive, or a String, try to be as specific as possible with the type signature.\n  For example, mark a property type as java.util.HashMap instead of java.util.Map, or, more generally, choose ConcreteSubClass over AbstractParentClassOrInterface. This will limit the assignable concrete types that the user of the app builder must choose from. For now, we only support property types that are public and either have a no-arg constructor themselves or their parent class does.\n\n\nMark properties that should be hidden in the app builder with the @omitFromUI javadoc annotation in the javadoc comment block above the getter of the property. This is a critical part of what an operator developer decides to expose for customization.\n/**\n * This is an example description of a property on an operator class\n * WS\n */\npublic String getMyProperty() { /* \u2026 */ }\n\n\n\n\n\nMake the tuple type of output ports strict and that of input ports liberal.\n  The tuple type that an output port emits must be assignable to the tuple type of an input port in order for them to connect. In other words, the input port must either be the exact type or a parent type of the output port tuple type. Because of this, building operators with more specific output and less specific input will make them more reusable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Builder Usage Examples\n\n\nPi Demo\n\n\nAs an example, we will rebuild the basic Pi demo. Please note that this example is relatively contrived and is only meant to illustrate how to connect compatible ports of operators to create a new application. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you will need to clone the malhar repository:\n\n\ngit@github.com:DataTorrent/Malhar.git \n cd Malhar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, run maven install, which will create the App Package jar need to upload to your gateway.\n\n\n\n\nFollow steps 2,3, and 4 of the Accessing the App Builder section above, but with the app package jar located in Malhar/demos/pi/target/pi-demo-{VERSION}.apa.\n\n\nAdd the Console Output\noperators.\n\n\nConnect the integer_data port of the Random Event Generator to the input port of the Pi Calculate operator, and connect the output port of the Pi Calculate operator to the input port of the Console Output operator.\n\n\nClick the \u201csave\u201d button in the top right.\n\n\nClick the \u201claunch\u201d button in the top right once it turns purple.\n\n\nIn the resulting modal, click \u201cLaunch\u201d, then the \u201cView it on the Dashboard\u201d link in the subsequent notification box.\n\n\nTo see the output of the Console Output operator, navigate to the stdout log file viewer of the container where the operator is running.",

This guide assumes the reader\u2019s basic knowledge on the DataTorrent RTS platform and the Console, and the concept of operators in streaming applications.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nTwitter Example\n\n\nThe Twitter Hashtag Count Demo, shipped with DataTorrent RTS distribution, is a streaming application that utilizes the App Data Framework.  To demonstrate how the Application Data Framework works on a very high level, on the Application page in the Console, click on the \nvisualize\n button next to the application name, and a dashboard for the Twitter Hashtag Count Demo will be created.  In it, you will see visualization of the top 10 hashtags computed in the application:\n\n\n\n\nAds Dimension Example\n\n\nThe Ads Dimension Demo included in the DataTorrent RTS distribution also utilizes the App Data Framework.  The widgets for this application demonstrates more features than the Twitter one because you can issue your own queries to choose what data you want to visualize.  For example, one might want to visualize the running revenue and cost for advertiser \u201cStarbucks\u201d and publisher \u201cGoogle\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nA Data Source in the application consists of three operators.  The embedded Query Operator, the Data Source Operator and the Result Operator.  The Query Operator takes in queries from a message queue and passes them to the Data Source Operator.  The Data Source Operator processes the queries and sends the results to the Result Operator.  The Result Operator delivers the results to the message queue.  The Data Source Operator generally takes in data from other parts of the DAG.\n\n\n\n\nTo see how this is fit in our previous examples, below is the DAG for the Twitter Hashtag Demo:\n\n\n\n\nThe operators SnapshotServer (which includes embedded Query Operator) and QueryResult are the operators that serve the data being visualized in the Console.  The SnapshotServer operator takes in data from the TopCounter operator, processes incoming queries, and generates results. The Twitter Hashtag Demo application and all its operators are available in the Apache Malhar repository.\n\n\nStats and Custom Metrics\n\n\nEach application has statistics such as tuples processed per second, latency, and memory used.  Each operator in an application can contain custom metrics that are part of the application logic.  With the Application Data Framework, each application comes with Data Sources that provide historical and real-time application statistics and custom metrics data.  You can visualize these metrics the same way as custom Data Sources in an application.\n\n\nData Visualization with Dashboards and Widgets\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nDataTorrent Dashboards and Widgets are UI tools that allow users to quickly and easily visualize historical and real-time application data.  Below is an example of a visualization dashboard with Stacked Area Chart, Pie Chart, Multi Bar Chart, and Table widgets.\n\n\n\n\nDashboards are quick and easy to create, and can include data from a single or multiple applications on the same screen.  Widgets can be added, removed, rearranged, and resized at any time.  Each widget provides a unique way to visualizes the application data, and provides a number of ways to configure the content and the corresponding visualizations.\n\n\nAccessing Dashboards\n\n\nDashboards are accessible from Visualize section in the DataTorrent Console menu.\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting Visualize menu item, a list of available dashboards is displayed.  The list of available dashboards can be ordered or filtered by dashboard name, description, included applications, creating user, and modified timestamp.  Clicking one of the dashboard name links takes you to the selected dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative way to access dashboards is from the Monitor section.  Navigate to one of the running applications, and if the application supports data visualization, using the \nvisualize\n button will display a list of existing dashboards that are associated with the application.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of accessing the data visualization dashboard from a running application.\nYou can also navigate back to the application from within the dashboard's menu.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Dashboards\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a new visualization dashboard\n\n\n\n\ncreate new\n button on the Dashboards screen\n\n\ncreate new dashboard\n option in the visualization menu of a compatible running DataTorrent application\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an illustrated example and a set of steps for creating a new dashboard from the Dashboards screen using the \ncreate new\n button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a unique dashboard name. Names are required to be unique for a single user.  Two different users can have a dashboard with the same name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude optional dashboard description.  Descriptions help explain and provide context for visualizations presented in the dashboard to new users, and provide an additional way to search and filter dashboards in the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize and save the dashboard.  Add, remove, resize, and customize the widgets.  Save the changes to preserve the current dashboard state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an illustrated example of creating a new dashboard with \ncreate new dashboard\n option in the visualization menu of a compatible running DataTorrent application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate visualize menu in the Application Summary section of a running application.  Only applications with compatible data visualization sources include visualize menu option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose to create new dashboard from the visualize menu drop-down list.  The new dashboard will be automatically named based on the application name and saved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize and save the dashboard.  Add, remove, resize, and customize the widgets.  Save the changes to preserve the current dashboard state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboard Controls\n\n\nDashboards controls are presented as a set of buttons to the right of the dashboard title.\n\n\nView Mode\n\n\nIn view mode, you are not allowed to modify the layout or add/edit widgets, but certain actions\ncan be taken in the dashboard menu.\n\n\n\n\nEdit Mode\n\n\nIn edit mode, you can add/edit widgets, change the dashboard layout, and change dashboard settings.\n\n\n\n\nDashboard Menu\n\n\nThe dashboard menu contains the rest of the dashboard functionality. The \nactions\n section is mostly self-explanatory, but see the \nPresentation Mode\n and \nPresentation Builder\n sections below for more information about presenting your dashboards. The \nassociated applications\n section displays the status of applications associated to the current dashboard and serves as a quick way to jump to those applications. Associated applications are selected based on the data sources of your widgets.\n\n\nNote\n: If an an associated application enters a non-running state (e.g. KILLED, INACTIVE), a warning icon will be displayed on the \ndashboard menu\n button.\n\n\n\n\nDashboard Settings\n\n\nThe dashboard settings interface allows you to change the dashboard name, description, logo image, and \nselect replacement associated applications\n.\n\n\nIt can be accessed from the \ndashboard menu\n using the \nsettings\n option.\n\n\n\n\nReplacing Associated Applications\n\n\nDashboards have widgets that rely on associated applications for data. These associated applications can be replaced in \ndashboard settings\n if the replacement is compatible with the current dashboard.\n\n\nThe replacement application must have a compatible data source. Selecting an application with an incompatible data source will simply skip the replacement process for that application. If the data source matches, but the data schema is incompatible, the widget will attempt to reset its settings to match the new data schema.\n\n\nWhen importing a dashboard, the interface tries its best to preselect the most compatible replacement application. Leaving fields blank means the replacement process for those applications will be skipped.\n\n\nPackaged Dashboards\n\n\nAuto Import When Launching An Application\n\n\nApplication packages may include packaged dashboards which can be imported. Application package developers may select some dashboards to be imported automatically when launching an application, and all packaged dashboards can be imported manually at any time from the Packaged Dashboards page.\n\n\n\n\nWhen launching an application, the \nImport Packaged Dashboards\n section will appear if there are packaged dashboards. Use the checkboxes to select which dashboards to import. The dashboard name and replacement applications can be changed (see \nreplacing associated applications\n).\n\n\nNote\n: Auto imports of packaged dashboards only happen if there isn't already an existing dashboard with the same name and owner. They can still be marked for import in the launch interface, but will have to be given a unique name.\n\n\nImport From A Running Application\n\n\nIf a running application has associated packaged dashboards, the packaged dashboards can be imported using the \nvisualize\n button in \nApplication Overview\n.\n\n\n\n\nClicking on a packaged dashboard in the dropdown will open an interface to change the dashboard name, description, logo image, and replacement applications before importing.\n\n\nNote\n: See the \nreplacing associated applications\n section for an explanation about replacement applications.\n\n\n\n\nPressing the \nimport\n button at the bottom of the interface imports the dashboard, and can then be accessed in the \nVisualize\n section.\n\n\nImport From Packaged Dashboards Page\n\n\nFor a list of all packaged dashboards across all your application packages, use the \nimport\n button in the \nVisualize\n section.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nimport\n button brings you to the following page where you can import or download individual packaged dashboards.\n\n\n\n\nWidgets Overview\n\n\nDashboard widgets receive and display data in real time from DataTorrent application data sources.  Widgets can be added, removed, rearranged, and resized at any time.  Each widget has a unique list of configurable properties, which include interactive elements displayed directly on the widget, as well as data query settings available from the widget settings.\n\n\nAdding Widgets\n\n\nWidgets can be added to the dashboard by clicking the \nadd widget\n button in edit mode, selecting one of the available data sources, selecting one or more widgets, and confirming selection by clicking add widget.\n\n\n\n\nEach data source supports one or more data schema types, such as snapshot and dimensions.  Each schema type has a specific list of compatible widgets which can be selected to visualize the data.\n\n\nResults are not persisted until you press the \nsave\n button.\n\n\nEditing Widgets\n\n\nEach widget has an dimensions, snapshot) and widget type (table, chart, text For snapshot schema, which represents a single point in time, the primary widget controls include\n\n\n\n\nlabel field selection\n\n\nquantity field selection\n\n\nsort order selection\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of changing label field and sort order for a bar chart widget.\n\n\n\n\nFor dimensions schema, which represents a series of points in time, with ability to configure dimensions based on key and value settings, the primary widget controls include\n\n\n\n\nTime ranges selection\n\n\nlive streaming\n\n\nhistorical range\n\n\nDimensions Selections\n\n\nkey combinations and key values selection\n\n\naggregate selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Notes widget, a text in Markdown format can be entered and should be translated to HTML look.  Below is an example of using Markdown syntax to produce headings, lists, and quoted text.\n\n\n\n\nAfter making the widget settings changes, remember to use \nsave\n button to persist the desired results.  If the resulting changes should not be saved, using the \ndiscard\n button will revert it to the the original state.\n\n\nControl Widget\n\n\nControl widget can be used to configure settings of one or more widgets on the dashboard.  This is a convenient way to configure multiple widgets settings in one place.  It is also the only way to change widgets settings in presentation mode.  However, settings changes in presentation mode will not be saved.\n\n\nControllable Widgets\n\n\nThe following widgets may be controlled by the Control Widget:\n\n\n\n\nDimensions Schema Data Source Widgets\n\n\nGeo Choropleth\n\n\nGeo Circles\n\n\nLine Chart\n\n\nMulti Bar Chart\n\n\nStacked Area Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Schema Data Source Widgets\n\n\nBar Chart\n\n\nHorizontal Bar Chart\n\n\nMulti Color Bar Chart\n\n\nPie Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllable Settings\n\n\nThe following settings may be controlled by the Control Widget:\n\n\n\n\nDimensions Schema Data Source Settings\n\n\nCircle Size \n(Geo Circle widget only)\n\n\nColor Intensity \n(Geo Choropleth widget only)\n\n\nGeo Coordinates \n(Geo Circle widget only)\n\n\nKeys Combinations and Aggregates\n\n\nTime Range Selection\n\n\nTooltip Values \n(Geo Choropleth and Circle widgets only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Schema Data Source Settings\n\n\nField to use as label\n\n\nField to use as quantity\n\n\nSort order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Control Widget\n\n\nControl Widget can be added just like any other widget.  See the \nAdding Widgets\n section for more details.\n\n\nAdding Widgets to Control\n\n\nClick the edit button on the Control Widget to show the available widgets to control, and change the controllable widget selections.\n\n\n\n\nThe Cotnrol Widget does not allow selection of dimensional and snapshot schema widgets together. If users happen to choose widgets with both schema types, then the \"OK\" button remains disabled until only one schema type is selected.\n\n\nThe control widget allows selection of widgets with different data sources. Users are warned that some setting sections in the control widget may be disabled if the schemas are incompatible.\n\n\n\n\nWhen widgets to be controlled have incompatible schemas, the incompatible sections remain disabled until mismatched widgets are removed in the control widget settings.  This issue can also be resolved if the widgets with incompatible schemas are removed from the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Control Widget in Action\n\n\nChanging the time range selection for the line and stacked area charts.\n\n\n\n\nChanging dimensional keys and aggregates.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the sorting option.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the geo circle settings.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the geo choropleth settings in presentation mode.\n\n\n\n\nPresentation Mode\n\n\nDashboards can be viewed in a fullscreen mode with main navigation elements removed.\n\n\n\n\nYou can access the Presentation Mode from the dashboard menu:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: To share your presentation, share the URL while inside Presentation Mode.\n\n\nPresentation Builder\n\n\nThe Presentation Builder can be used to create a presentation with multiple dashboards.\nThe dashboard you launch the Presentation Builder from is the \nhome dashboard\n, which means\nthat dashboard will serve as the starting point of your presentation. To start the presentation,\njust enter Presentation Mode from the home dashboard.",

Here are some of things you can do with the REST API:\n\n\n\n\nGet performance metrics (e.g. CPU, memory usage, tuples per second, latency, etc.) and other details of all Apex application instances\n\n\nGet performance metrics and other details of physical and logical operators of each Apex application instance\n\n\nGet performance metrics and other details of individual containers used by each Apex application instance\n\n\nRetrieve container logs\n\n\nDynamically change operator properties, and add and remove operators from the DAG of a running Apex application\n\n\nRecord and retrieve tuples on the fly\n\n\nShutdown a running container or an entire Apex application\n\n\nDynamically change logging level of a container\n\n\nCreate, manage, and view custom system alerts\n\n\nCreate, manage, and interact with dtDashboard\n\n\nCreate, manage, and launch Apex App Packages\n\n\nBasic health checks of the cluster\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nWith all the information dtGateway has and what dtGateway can do, the admin of DataTorrent RTS may want to restrict access to certain information and operations to only certain group of users. This means dtGateway must support authentication and authorization.  For authentication, dtGateway can easily be integrated with existing LDAP, Kerberos, or PAM framework.  You can also choose to have dtGateway manage its own user database.\n\n\nFor authorization, dtGateway provides built-in role-based access control. The admin can decide which roles can view what information and perform what operations in dtGateway. The user-to-role mapping can be managed by dtGateway, or be integrated with LDAP roles.  In addition, we provide access control with granularity to the application instance level as well as to the application package level. For example, you can control which users and which roles have read or write access to which application instances and to which application packages.\n\n\nFor information on configuring security see \ndtGateway security\n guide.\n\n\nSystem Alerts\n\n\nSystem Alerts provide a way for users to monitor cluster and application metrics. When an alert condition (written in JavaScript) turns true and stays that way for a configured time interval, dtGateway sends email to the configured list of email addresses. The same is true when the condition turns false. Alerts are created via the \nPUT /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/{name}\n call documented in the \nREST API\n. For more details on System Alerts, please see \nthis document\n.\n\n\nRest API\n\n\nHere is an example of using the curl command to access dtGateway\u2019s REST API to get the details of a physical operator with ID=40 of application instance with ID=application_1442448722264_14891, assuming dtGateway is listening at localhost:9090\n\n\n$ curl http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/applications/application_1442448722264_14891/physicalPlan/operators/40\n{\n  \ncheckpointStartTime\n: \n1442512091772\n,\n  \ncheckpointTime\n: \n175\n,\n  \ncheckpointTimeMA\n: \n164\n,\n  \nclassName\n: \ncom.datatorrent.contrib.kafka.KafkaSinglePortOutputOperator\n,\n  \ncontainer\n: \ncontainer_e08_1442448722264_14891_01_000017\n,\n  \ncounters\n: null,\n  \ncpuPercentageMA\n: \n0.2039266316727741\n,\n  \ncurrentWindowId\n: \n6195527785184762469\n,\n  \nfailureCount\n: \n0\n,\n  \nhost\n: \nnode22.morado.com:8041\n,\n  \nid\n: \n40\n,\n  \nlastHeartbeat\n: \n1442512100742\n,\n  \nlatencyMA\n: \n5\n,\n  \nlogicalName\n: \nQueryResult\n,\n  \nmetrics\n: {},\n  \nname\n: \nQueryResult\n,\n  \nports\n: [\n    {\n      \nbufferServerBytesPSMA\n: \n0\n,\n      \nname\n: \ninputPort\n,\n      \nqueueSizeMA\n: \n1\n,\n      \nrecordingId\n: null,\n      \ntotalTuples\n: \n6976\n,\n      \ntuplesPSMA\n: \n0\n,\n      \ntype\n: \ninput\n\n    }\n  ],\n  \nrecordingId\n: null,\n  \nrecoveryWindowId\n: \n6195527785184762451\n,\n  \nstatus\n: \nACTIVE\n,\n  \ntotalTuplesEmitted\n: \n0\n,\n  \ntotalTuplesProcessed\n: \n6976\n,\n  \ntuplesEmittedPSMA\n: \n0\n,\n  \ntuplesProcessedPSMA\n: \n20\n,\n  \nunifierClass\n: null\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor the complete spec of the REST API, please refer to dtGateway \nREST API\n.\n\n\nFor information on configuring dtGateway in general, see \nDataTorrent RTS Configuration",

            "text": "DT Gateway System Alerts\n\n\nThe DT Gateway allows the user to create system alerts using JavaScript expressions.\nValues in the expressions can come from PubSub websocket topics and include values\nlike system metrics, application metrics, and custom application counters.\nAlert configurations are stored in the Hadoop cluster and therefore persist across\ngateway restarts; however, some state information about the alert (such as: whether\nit is active or not and a historical record of when it was triggered in the past)\nwill be lost when the gateway is restarted, since it is stored in memory.\n\n\nAlerts and Topics\n\n\nAs described above the trigger for an alert is a JavaScript expression potentially\ninvolving a variety of metrics. When the expression evaluates to true and remains so\nfor a configured duration, the alert becomes active and email is sent to a configured\nlist of addresses. Likewise, when the condition turns false, the alert becomes inactive\nand another email about the state change is sent.\n\n\nHere is an example for simple JavaScript condition; we can make a REST call to create an\nalert named \nxyz\n which emails to \nsomeone@company.com\n when the number of running\napplications is greater than 5 for at least 60 seconds; the JSON object is the payload:\n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/xyz\n\n\n{\n  \ncondition\n:\n_topic['cluster.metrics'].numAppsRunning \n 5\n,\n  \nemail\n:\nsomeone@company.com\n,\n  \ndescription\n: \nNo.of apps running is more than 5\n,\n  \ntimeThresholdMillis\n:\n60000\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the number of running applications is greater than 5 for more than 60 seconds, a simple\nemail will be sent to \nsomeone@company.com\n, stating that the alert is in effect, and when\nthe number of running applications drops below 6, another email will be sent, stating that\nthe alert is no longer in effect.\n\n\nThe condition is a simple JavaScript expression which the user can build\nfrom various system or application-specific values. These values are available as fields\nof JavaScript objects representing WebSocket topics obtained with expressions of the\nform \n_topic[\ntopic_name\n]\n.\nThe topic names can be looked up using the \nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/topicData\n REST API\ncall shown below (please note that alert names may contain special characters such as\nspaces, slashes and percents but they must be URL-encoded before making REST API calls\nsuch as \nGet\n, \nPut\n, and \nDelete\n):\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/topicData\n\n\n{\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.logicalOperators\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.physicalOperators\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.containers\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n: {...}\n  \ncluster.metrics\n: {...},\n  \napplications\n: {...}\n}\n\n\n\n\nwhere \napplicationId\n refers to the application id of a running application\n(which typically has the form \napplication_1482319446115_4314\n). These topics\nexist for every running application. The alert condition can refer to multiple such topic values and\ncan be any valid JavaScript expressions that return a boolean. A comma separated list of\nemail addresses can be specified.\n\n\nConfiguring SMTP for Email\n\n\nSMTP needs to be configured for the gateway to be able to send alert emails via an \n\nSMTP server\n. Make\na note of the following steps before attempting to configure SMTP in the gateway.\n\n\n\n\nmake sure there is an SMTP server in the network the gateway will have access to. Note down the\nSMTP server's hostname and port number (please see the note below regarding encryption-type).\n\n\nif the SMTP server supports or requires \nTLS or SSL encryption\n,\ndetermine the encryption-type for the communication between the gateway and the SMTP server. The values for\nencryption-type are \"tls\", \"ssl\" or \"none\" (i.e. no encryption). In case \"tls\" or \"ssl\" is used,\nensure appropriate certificates are installed to establish \ntrust\n.\n\n\ndetermine the authentication-type for your SMTP server. The only supported values are \"password\" (i.e. authentication using\nusername and password) or \"none\" (i.e. no authentication).\n\n\nif you choose the \"password\" authentication-type, you will need the SMTP-username and SMTP-password to be used\nby the gateway to authenticate with the SMTP server.\n\n\ndetermine the \"fromAddr\" and the \"fromName\" for the emails sent by the gateway which the email recipient\nwill see as the sender of the emails. Note that for certain SMTP servers the \"fromAddr\" and the SMTP-username\nmay need to match or else the latter overrides the former.\n\n\ndetermine a \"test-address\" where you can receive emails to verify validity of the SMTP configuration.\n\n\nin case you choose the \"password\" authentication-type, you will need to set up an SSL keystore as described\n\nhere\n. The gateway uses the keystore to encrypt and\ndecrypt your SMTP-password.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the following APIs to set or retrieve the SMTP configuration. Note that the JSON sample following the\nPUT request is the payload of the request. \n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/config/smtp\n\n\n{\n\nhost\n: \nsmtp.gmail.com\n,\n\nport\n: \n587\n,\n\nfromAddr\n: \nno-reply@mydomain.com\n,\n\nfromName\n: \nDo Not Reply\n,\n\nencryptionType\n: \ntls\n,\n\nauthType\n: \npassword\n,\n\nusername\n: \nsmtp-user@mydomain.com\n,\n\npassword\n: \nsecret_password\n,\n\ntestAddr\n: \ntestuser@yourdomain.com\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nContents of the JSON Object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Key\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nthe SMTP hostname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport\n\n\nthe SMTP port on the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromAddr\n\n\nthe \"from-address\" described above i.e. the address from which the alert email is sent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromName\n\n\nthe \"from-name\" described above i.e. the user friendly string for the \"from-address\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryptionType\n\n\nthe \"encryption-type\" value described above i.e. \"tls\", \"ssl\" or \"none\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthType\n\n\nthe \"authentication-type\" value described above i.e. \"password\" or \"none\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nthe \"SMTP-username\" value described above\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nthe \"SMTP-password\" value described above\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntestAddr\n\n\nthe \"test-address\" value described above. The gateway sends a test email to this address when you use this API to set the SMTP configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note about password: if you omit the \"password\" value in your JSON object in the API, the gateway will use the existing saved password\nso the client does not need to include the password in subsequent API calls. Note that the GET API (described below) never returns the\npassword of the SMTP configuration, hence the DataTorrent console is able to use this feature without either displaying or requiring the \nuser to re-enter the previous password. Note that the JSON sample following the GET request is the value returned from the GET request.\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/config/smtp\n\n\n{\n\nhost\n: \nsmtp.gmail.com\n,\n\nport\n: \n587\n,\n\nfromAddr\n: \nno-reply@mydomain.com\n,\n\nfromName\n: \nDo Not Reply\n,\n\nencryptionType\n: \ntls\n,\n\nauthType\n: \npassword\n,\n\nusername\n: \nsmtp-user@mydomain.com\n,\n\ntestAddr\n: \ntestuser@yourdomain.com\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe GET API returns the existing SMTP configuration in the gateway. As mentioned above, the SMTP-password\nvalue is never returned for security reasons.\n\n\nManaging and viewing alerts\n\n\nThe following operations are available in the Gateway REST API:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete an alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet alert history\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView content and status of alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView all the current data in the \n_topic\n array\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating an alert\n\n\nTo create an alert, the user needs to specify the alert name, condition,\nemail address and duration in milliseconds. As explained above, the condition\ncan refer to values in various topic objects including system metrics,\napplication metrics, and custom application counters and must yield a Boolean\nvalue.\n\n\nComplex JavaScript Expressions :\n\n\nThe following example shows how to issue a REST request to create an alert named\n\nWordCountAppNotRunning\n which emails to \nphil@company.com\n and \nmike@company.com\n\nwhen the \nWordCount\n app is not in the \nRUNNING\n state for at least 60 seconds.\n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/WordCountAppNotRunning\n\n\n{\n  \ncondition\n: \n_topic['applications.application_1480063135007_0543']['state'] != 'RUNNING'\n,\n  \nemail\n:\nphil@company.com, mike@company.com\n,\n  \ndescription\n: \nWordCount Application is not running\n,\n  \ntimeThresholdMillis\n:\n60000\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe above alert works for the current invocation of the \nWordCount\n application; however,\nwhen the application is restarted, a new application \nid\n is generated for which this alert\nwill no longer work. To avoid having to update the application \nid\n in the condition each\ntime the application restarts, we can write a more complex JavaScript expression to find\nthe application \nid\n for the given application as shown below:\n\n\nvar alert = false;\nvar appId = undefined;\nvar appsInfo = _topic['applications'].apps;\n\nfor(i = 0; i \n appsInfo.length; i++)\n{\n    if (appsInfo[i].name == 'WordCount')\n    {\n        appId = appsInfo[i].id;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (appId != undefined)\n{\n    alert  = _topic['applications.' + appId]['state']  !=  'RUNNING' ;\n}\nalert;\n\n\n\n\nThe JavaScript expression must however be written as a single line; tools such as\n\njavascriptcompressor\n are useful for this purpose.\nAny HTML in the expression also needs to be escaped. Here is new alert\nwith the revised complex expression compressed to a single line:\n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/WordCountAppNotRunning\n\n\n{\n  \ncondition\n: \nvar alert=false;var appId=undefined;var appsInfo=_topic['applications'].apps;for(i=0;i\nappsInfo.length;i++){if(appsInfo[i].name=='WordCount'){appId=appsInfo[i].id;break}}if(appId!=undefined){alert=_topic['applications.'+appId]['state']!='RUNNING'}alert;\n,\n   \nemail\n:\nphil@company.com, mike@company.com\n,\n   \ndescription\n: \nWordCount Application is not running\n,\n   \ntimeThresholdMillis\n:\n60000\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nDeleting an alert\n\n\nWe can delete an alert with the DELETE REST API request:\n\n\nDELETE /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/{name}\n\n\nAlerts history\n\n\nWe can get the alerts history with the GET REST API request:\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/history\n\n\nIt returns a result of the following form:\n\n\n{\n\nhistory\n: [{\n    \nname\n: \nxyz\n,\n    \ninTime\n: \n1481235199598\n,\n    \noutTime\n: \n1481235251088\n,\n    \nmessage\n: \nNo.of apps running is more than 5\n\n},{\n    \nname\n: \ncheckCsvParserNotRunning\n,\n    \ninTime\n: \n1481235251087\n,\n    \noutTime\n: \n1481235549648\n,\n    \nmessage\n: \nApplication is not running\n\n}],\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe alert history comprises the alert name, time it became active (\ninTime\n), time it\nbecame inactive (\noutTime\n) and message. The alert history is obtained through the gateway,\nso whenever gateway is restarted the alerts history gets cleared.\n\n\nViewing the content and the status of alerts\n\n\nWe can get the content and status of alerts with the GET REST API web request:\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/{name}\n\n\nIt returns a result of the following form:\n\n\n{\n \nname\n: \ncheckLatencyApp\n,\n \ncondition\n: \nvar alert=false;var appId=undefined;var appsInfo=_topic['applications'].apps;for(i=0;i\nappsInfo.length;i++){if(appsInfo[i].name=='xyzApp'){appId=appsInfo[i].id;break}}if(appId!=undefined){var expTopic='applications.'+appId+'.physicalOperators';var operators=_topic[expTopic].operators;for(i=0;(i\noperators.length);++i){if(operators[i].latencyMA\n50){alert=true;break}}}alert;\n,\n \nemail\n: \nphil@company.com, mike@company.com\n,\n \ndescription\n: \nchecking latency \n 50\n,\n \ntimeThresholdMillis\n: \n10000\n,\n \nalertStatus\n: {\n   \nisInAlert\n: true,\n   \ninTime\n: \n1481264665450\n,\n   \nemailSent\n: true,\n   \nmessage\n: \nchecking latency \n 50\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe result includes the alert name, condition, email addresses, description and duration.\nIt also alert status info such as \nisInAlert\n which indicates whether it is still active\nor not, \ninTime\n which represents the time the alert became active, \nemailSent\n which,\nas the name suggests, indicates if email was sent, and \nmessage\n which is similar to the\ndescription.\n\n\nViewing all the current data in the \n_topic\n array\n\n\nThis section is already covered under \nAlerts and Topics\n .",

As part of enabling enterprises extract value quickly, Malhar operators help get data in, analyze it in real-time and get data out of Hadoop in real-time with no paradigm limitations.  In addition to the operators, the library contains a number of demos applications, demonstrating operator features and capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nCapabilities common across Malhar operators\n\n\nFor most streaming platforms, connectors are afterthoughts and often end up being simple \u2018bolt-ons\u2019 to the platform. As a result they often cause performance issues or data loss when put through failure scenarios and scalability requirements. Malhar operators do not face these issues as they were designed to be integral parts of apex*.md RTS. Hence, they have following core streaming runtime capabilities\n\n\n\n\nFault tolerance\n \u2013 Apache Apex Malhar operators where applicable have fault tolerance built in. They use the checkpoint capability provided by the framework to ensure that there is no data loss under ANY failure scenario.\n\n\nProcessing guarantees\n \u2013 Malhar operators where applicable provide out of the box support for ALL three processing guarantees \u2013 exactly once, at-least once \n at-most once WITHOUT requiring the user to write any additional code.  Some operators like MQTT operator deal with source systems that cant track processed data and hence need the operators to keep track of the data. Malhar has support for a generic operator that uses alternate storage like HDFS to facilitate this. Finally for databases that support transactions or support any sort of atomic batch operations Malhar operators can do exactly once down to the tuple level.\n\n\nDynamic updates\n \u2013 Based on changing business conditions you often have to tweak several parameters used by the operators in your streaming application without incurring any application downtime. You can also change properties of a Malhar operator at runtime without having to bring down the application.\n\n\nEase of extensibility\n \u2013 Malhar operators are based on templates that are easy to extend.\n\n\nPartitioning support\n \u2013 In streaming applications the input data stream often needs to be partitioned based on the contents of the stream. Also for operators that ingest data from external systems partitioning needs to be done based on the capabilities of the external system. E.g. With the Kafka or Flume operator, the operator can automatically scale up or down based on the changes in the number of Kafka partitions or Flume channels\n\n\n\n\nOperator Library Overview\n\n\nInput/output connectors\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the various sub categories of input and output operators. Input operators also have a corresponding output operator\n\n\n\n\nFile Systems\n \u2013 Most streaming analytics use cases we have seen require the data to be stored in HDFS or perhaps S3 if the application is running in AWS. Also, customers often need to re-run their streaming analytical applications against historical data or consume data from upstream processes that are perhaps writing to some NFS share. Hence, it\u2019s not just enough to be able to save data to various file systems. You also have to be able to read data from them. RTS supports input \n output operators for HDFS, S3, NFS \n Local Files\n\n\nFlume\n \u2013 NOTE: Flume operator is not yet part of Malhar\n\n\n\n\nMany customers have existing Flume deployments that are being used to aggregate log data from variety of sources. However Flume does not allow analytics on the log data on the fly. The Flume input/output operator enables RTS to consume data from flume and analyze it in real-time before being persisted.\n\n\n\n\nRelational databases\n \u2013 Most stream processing use cases require some reference data lookups to enrich, tag or filter streaming data. There is also a need to save results of the streaming analytical computation to a database so an operational dashboard can see them. RTS supports a JDBC operator so you can read/write data from any JDBC compliant RDBMS like Oracle, MySQL etc.\n\n\nNoSQL databases\n \u2013NoSQL key-value pair databases like Cassandra \n HBase are becoming a common part of streaming analytics application architectures to lookup reference data or store results. Malhar has operators for HBase, Cassandra, Accumulo (common with govt. \n healthcare companies) MongoDB \n CouchDB.\n\n\nMessaging systems\n \u2013 JMS brokers have been the workhorses of messaging infrastructure in most enterprises. Also Kafka is fast coming up in almost every customer we talk to. Malhar has operators to read/write to Kafka, any JMS implementation, ZeroMQ \n RabbitMQ.\n\n\nNotification systems\n \u2013 Almost every streaming analytics application has some notification requirements that are tied to a business condition being triggered. Malhar supports sending notifications via SMTP \n SNMP. It also has an alert escalation mechanism built in so users don\u2019t get spammed by notifications (a common drawback in most streaming platforms)\n\n\nIn-memory Databases \n Caching platforms\n - Some streaming use cases need instantaneous access to shared state across the application. Caching platforms and in-memory databases serve this purpose really well. To support these use cases, Malhar has operators for memcached \n Redis\n\n\nProtocols\n - Streaming use cases driven by machine-to-machine communication have one thing in common \u2013 there is no standard dominant protocol being used for communication. Malhar currently has support for MQTT. It is one of the more commonly, adopted protocols we see in the IoT space. Malhar also provides connectors that can directly talk to HTTP, RSS, Socket, WebSocket \n FTP sources\n\n\n\n\nCompute\n\n\nOne of the most important promises of a streaming analytics platform like Apache Apex is the ability to do analytics in real-time. However delivering on the promise becomes really difficult when the platform does not provide out of the box operators to support variety of common compute functions as the user then has to worry about making these scalable, fault tolerant etc. Malhar takes this responsibility away from the application developer by providing a huge variety of out of the box computational operators. The application developer can thus focus on the analysis.\n\n\nBelow is just a snapshot of the compute operators available in Malhar\n\n\n\n\nStatistics \n Math - Provide various mathematical and statistical computations over application defined time windows.\n\n\nFiltering \n pattern matching\n\n\nMachine learning \n Algorithms\n\n\nReal-time model scoring is a very common use case for stream processing platforms. \nMalhar allows users to invoke their R models from streaming applications\n\n\nSorting, Maps, Frequency, TopN, BottomN, Random Generator etc.\n\n\n\n\nQuery \n Script invocation\n\n\nMany streaming use cases are legacy implementations that need to be ported over. This often requires re-use some of the existing investments and code that perhaps would be really hard to re-write. With this in mind, Malhar supports invoking external scripts and queries as part of the streaming application using operators for invoking SQL query, Shell script, Ruby, Jython, and JavaScript etc.\n\n\nParsers\n\n\nThere are many industry vertical specific data formats that a streaming application developer might need to parse. Often there are existing parsers available for these that can be directly plugged into an Apache Apex application. For example in the Telco space, a Java based CDR parser can be directly plugged into Apache Apex operator. To further simplify development experience, Malhar also provides some operators for parsing common formats like XML (DOM \n SAX), JSON (flat map converter), Apache log files, syslog, etc.\n\n\nStream manipulation\n\n\nStreaming data aka \u2018stream\u2019 is raw data that inevitably needs processing to clean, filter, tag, summarize etc. The goal of Malhar is to enable the application developer to focus on \u2018WHAT\u2019 needs to be done to the stream to get it in the right format and not worry about the \u2018HOW\u2019. Hence, Malhar has several operators to perform the common stream manipulation actions like \u2013 DeDupe, GroupBy, Join, Distinct/Unique, Limit, OrderBy, Split, Sample, Inner join, Outer join, Select, Update etc.\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\nMalhar includes an operator to connect to the popular Twitter stream fire hose.",

The application developer can thus focus on the analysis.  Below is just a snapshot of the compute operators available in Malhar   Statistics   Math - Provide various mathematical and statistical computations over application defined time windows.

See \ninstallation guide\n for details.\n\n\n(install dir)/conf/custom-env.sh\n\n\nThis file can be used to configure behavior of DT Gateway service,\nas well as \napex\n command line utility. \u00a0After adding custom properties\nto this file, dtgateway and Apex CLI utilities need to be restarted for\nchanges to take effect.\n\n\nExample custom-env.sh configuration:\n\n\n# Increase DT Gateway memory to 2GB\nDT_GATEWAY_HEAP_MEM=2048m\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables available for configuration\n\n\n\n\nDT_GATEWAY_HEAP_MEM\n \n Maximum heap size allocated to DT Gateway service.  Default is 1024m.\n\n\nDT_GATEWAY_DEBUG\n \n Set to 1 to enable additional debug information in the dtgateway.log\n\n\nDT_CLASSPATH\n \n Classpath used to load additional jars or properties for Apex CLI and dtgateway\n\n\nDT_LOG_DIR\n \n Directory for log files\n\n\nDT_RUN_DIR\n \n Directory for process id and other temporary files\ncreated at run time\n\n\n\n\n(user home)/.dt/dt-site.xml\n\n\nThis file is used to customize the DataTorrent platform and the behavior of\napplications. \u00a0It can be particularly useful for changing\nGateway application connection address, or configuring environment specific\nsettings, such as specific machine names, IP addresses, or performance\nsettings which may change from environment to environment.\n\n\nExample of a single property configuration in dt-site.xml:\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \nproperty\n\n      \nname\ndt.operator.MyCustomStore.host\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\n192.168.2.35\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n   \u2026\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nGateway Configuration Properties\n\n\n\n\ndt.gateway.listenAddress\n - The address and port DT Gateway listens to.  Defaults to 0.0.0.0:9090\n\n\ndt.gateway.autoPublishInterval\n - The interval in milliseconds DT Gateway should publish application information on the websocket channel.  Default is 1000.\n\n\ndt.gateway.sslKeystorePath\n - Specifying of the SSL Key store path enables HTTPS on the DT Gateway (See the \ndtGateway Security\n document)\n\n\ndt.gateway.sslKeystorePassword\n - The password of the SSL key store (See the \ndtGateway Security\n document)\n\n\ndt.gateway.allowCrossOrigin\n - Setting it to true allows cross origin HTTP access to the DT Gateway.  Default is false.\n\n\ndt.gateway.authentication.(OPTION)\n - Determines the scheme of Hadoop security authentication (See the \ndtGateway Security\n document).\n\n\ndt.gateway.http.authentication\n - Determines the scheme of DT Gateway HTTP security authentication (See the \ndtGateway Security\n document).\n\n\ndt.gateway.staticResourceDirectory\n - The document root directory where the DT Gateway should serve from for the /static HTTP path.\n\n\n\n\nApplication Configuration Properties\n\n\nFor a complete list of configurable application properties see the Attributes\u00a0section below.\n\n\n\n\nResources Management and Performance Tuning\n\n\nThe platform provides continuous information about CPU, Memory, and Network\nusage for the system as a whole, individual running applications,\noperators, streams, and various internal components.  These statistics\nare available via \nREST API\n, \nApex CLI\n, and \ndtManage\n.\n\n\nThe platform is also responsible for\n\n\n\n\nHonoring the resource restrictions enforced by the YARN RM and taking\n    preventive action to ensure they are met. This is done at both launch time\n    (fit the execution plan to the number of containers and their\n    sizes), as well as at run time.\n\n\nHonoring resource constraints an application developer\n    may provide such as the amount of memory allocated to individual operators,\n    associated buffer servers, or the number of partitions.\n\n\n\n\nSTRAM works with the YARN RM on a continual basis to ensure that resource\nconstraints are met. As a multi-tenant application, it is crucial to be able to\nperform within given resource limits. The design of the platform enables\neffective management of all three types of resources (CPU, Memory, I/O).\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nCPU utilization is computed on a per-thread basis within a container by the\nStreamingContainer; this value is also, in effect, the per-operator value\nsince each operator is a single threaded application. CPU utilization is also\ncomputed for the buffer-server as well as other common tasks within a container.\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\nNetwork usage management is needed to ensure that desired latency and\nthroughput levels are achieved and any applicable SLA terms are met.\n\n\nThe platform provides real-time statistics on the number of bytes or tuples\nprocessed by each operator. Application developers can modulate network traffic\nusing a couple of mechanisms:\n- Adjust the locality of streams: Using THREAD_LOCAL or CONTAINER_LOCAL\n  can reduce network load substantially as discussed below.\n- Adjust the number of partitions and unifiers.\n\n\nRAM\n\n\nSTRAM keeps track of resource usage on per container basis. Appropriate\nattributes can be set to limit the amount of RAM on a per-operator or\nper-container basis.\n\n\nSpike Management\n\n\nStreaming applications do not have the same throughput (events/second) for\nall 24 hours of the day; occasional spikes in the incoming data rate are common.\nMost streaming applications resolve this dichotomy\nby providing resources for the peak. So, resource utilization is\nsuboptimal for most of the day because resources, though unused, are locked up\nand therefore unusable by other applications in a multi-tenant environment.\n\n\nThe platform provides mechanisms to manage the spikes by adding partitions\nduring peak, and removing them once the spike subsides.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\nPartitioning is a core mechanism to distribute computation (and the associated\nresource utilization) across the cluster. It is discussed, along with the\nrelated concept of unifiers, in greater detail in\n\nApplication development\n and \nOperator Development\n.\n\n\nStream Modes\n\n\nThe platform support 5 stream modes, namely THREAD_LOCAL\n(intra-thread), CONTAINER_LOCAL (intra process/jvm), NODE_LOCAL (intra\nnode), RACK_LOCAL (same rack), and unspecified. While designing an application,\nthe modes should be decided carefully. All\nstream-modes are hints to the STRAM, and hence could be ignored if\nresources are not available, and could be changed on a run-time basis.\nThere are pros and cons of each.\n\n\n\n\nTHREAD_LOCAL\n: All the operators of the ports on this stream\n    share the same thread. Tuples are thus passed via the thread call stack.\n    The performance is massive and go into 100s of millions\n    of tuples/sec. Do note that if the operations are compute intensive,\n    them THREAD_LOCAL may not perform better than CONTAINER_LOCAL.\n    Thread call stack is extremely efficient in terms of I/O (there is\n    no I/O here), but the same thread does both the upstream and\n    downstream computation. A limitation is that all downstream\n    operators on this stream must have only one input port connected. If\n    the JVM process is lost, all the operators are lost, and will be\n    restarted again in another container.\n\n\nCONTAINER_LOCAL\n: All the operators of the ports on this\n    stream are in the same process. Each denotes a separate thread, and\n    tuples are passed in memory via a connectionBuffer as the intra-process\n    communication mechanism.\n    This mode has very high throughput and can easily do more than\n    million tuples/sec. However, since there is no bufferserver, features that\n    it provides (spooling, persistence) are not available, so memory needs\n    may grow.\n    This mode relies on the downstream operators consuming tuples, on average,\n    at least as fast as they are emitted by the upstream operator. As with the\n    previous mode, if the JVM process is\n    lost, all the operators are lost, and will be restarted again in\n    another container.\n\n\nNODE_LOCAL\n: All operators on this stream are on the\n    same node. Inter-process communication via the local loopback interface is\n    used. This mode is also very fast, as data does not traverse the NIC\n    but it has a buffer-server and so all the features that the buffer-server\n    provides (spooling, persistence) are available. If one container dies, all\n    the operators in that container will obviously need to be recreated and\n    restarted, but other operators remain unaffected. However if\n    a node dies then all of its containers and the operators hosted by them\n    need to be restarted.\n\n\nRACK_LOCAL\n: All operators on this stream are in the\n    same rack. Communication is not as fast as the previous modes since data\n    needs to pass through the NIC. Like the previous mode, it has a\n    buffer-server and so all the features that buffer-server provides are\n    available. Use of this mode reduces the probability of multi-operator\n    outage since multiple operators are not constrained to run on the same\n    node. This mode however will be affected by outage of a switch.\n\n\nUnspecified: This is the default mode and STRAM makes no special effort\n    to achieve any particular locality. There are thus no guarantees on whether\n    a stream will cross rack, node, or process boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Tenancy and Security\n\n\nThe platform is a YARN native application, and so all security features\navailable in Hadoop also apply for securing Apache Apex applications.\n\nThe default security for the streaming application is Kerberos based.\n\n\nKerberos Authentication\n\n\nKerberos is a ticket based authentication system that provides\nauthentication in a distributed environment where authentication between\nmultiple users, hosts and services is needed. It is the de-facto\nauthentication mechanism supported in Hadoop. To use Kerberos\nauthentication, the Hadoop installation must first be configured for\nsecure mode with Kerberos. Please refer to the administration guide of\nyour Hadoop distribution on how to do that. Once Hadoop is running with\nKerberos security enabled, DataTorrent platform also needs to be\nconfigured for Kerberos. There are two parts of the platform that need\nto be configured, CLI (Command Line Interface) and DT Gateway.\n\n\nCLI Configuration\n\n\nThe DataTorrent command line interface is used to launch\napplications along with performing various other operations on\napplications. The security configuration for the CLI program is described in the Apache Apex security document available \nhere\n.\n\n\nDT Gateway Configuration\n\n\nDT Gateway is a service that provides the backend functionality\nfor the DataTorrent UI console. In a Hadoop cluster with Kerberos security enabled additional configuration is needed for this service to communicate with Hadoop. This is described in \nGateway Security\n.\n\n\nConsole Authentication\n\n\nAccess to the UI console can be secured by having users authenticate before they can access the contents of the console. Different authentication mechanisms are supported including local password,\nKerberos and LDAP. Please refer to \nGateway Security\n for details of how to configure this.\n\n\nRun-Time Management\n\n\nUnlike Map-Reduce, streaming applications never end. They are designed\nto run 24x7, processing a continuous stream of input data. This makes run-time\nmanagement of the applications very critical. The platform provides strong\nsupport for various operations. These include\n\n\n\n\nRuntime metrics and stats on various components of the\n    application including aggregated metrics\n\n\nAbility to change the logical plan, physical plan, and\n    execution plan of the application\n\n\nAbility to dump the current state of the application to enable\n    re-launch (in case of Hadoop grid outage)\n\n\nIntegration of STRAM state with Zookeeper (in later versions)\n\n\nDebugger, charting, and other tools triggered at run time\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Functional Modifications\n\n\nPlatform supports changes to an application at multiple stages.\nApplication design parameters (attributes and properties) can be\nchanged at launch time via the job configuration file and during runtime via\nthe \napex\n tool or using the REST webservice calls. Support for runtime\nchanges is critical for operability as it enables changes to a running\napplication without being forced to kill it. This is a critical need for\nstreaming applications and a significant difference from map-reduce/batch\napplications.\n\n\nFrom an operational perspective, the platform will allow changes\nin both the logical plan (query modification, or properties\nmodifications) and the physical plan (attribute modification generally and\npartitioning changes specifically).\n\n\nExamples of dynamic changes to logical plan include\n-   Changing properties of an operator\n-   Adding or deleting a sub-dag. Some examples are\n  -   Change in persistence\n  -   Insertion of charts, debugger etc.\n  -   Query insertion on a particular stream\n\n\nAny change to a logical plan will change the physical and the\nexecution plan. Examples of dynamic changes only to physical plan\ninclude\n\n\n\n\nChange in attributes that triggers STRAM to change the number\n    of physical operators.\n\n\nRuntime changes in load or grid resources (via RM, or\n    outages), that triggers STRAM to change the physical plan to meet\n    SLA, latency, resources usage goals\n\n\nDirect request to change the number of partitions of\n    an operator. For example new input adapters to handle expected\n    uptick in ingestion rate\n\n\n\n\nAny change to a physical plan will change the execution plan.\nExamples of dynamic changes only to the execution plan include\n\n\n\n\nChanges in attributes that need a new execution plan\n\n\nChanges to stream modes\n\n\nNode recovery from an outage\n\n\n\n\nRuntime Code\n\n\nSTRAM is able to reuse and move any code that is supplied with the\ninitial launch of the application. The default behavior is for the jar\nto include all the library templates in addition to the application\ncode. This enables STRAM to make changes to the application as the code\nis already available.\n\n\nLoad\n\n\nSTRAM manages runtime changes to ensure that the application\nscales up and down. This includes changes in load, changes in skew,\nchanges in resource behavior (network goes slow) etc. STRAM proactively\nmonitors the application and will make run time changes as\nneeded.\n\n\nUptime\n\n\nNode recovery is a change in the execution plan caused by external\nevents (node outage) or RM taking resources back (preemption). The\nplatform enables node recovery in three modes, namely, at least once, at\nmost once, and exactly once. SLA enforcement in terms of latency,\nuptime, etc. is done via runtime changes.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nAttribute specification is the process by which operational\ncustomization is achieved. Currently, modification of attributes on an\napplication that is already running is not supported. We intend to add\nthis in future versions on an attribute by attribute basis. Attributes\nare parameters that the platform recognizes and acts on and are not part\nof user code. Attributes are the mechanism by which platform features\ncan be customized. They are specified with a key and a value. In this\nsection we list the attributes, their default values, and briefly\nexplain what they do.\n\n\nThere are three kinds of attributes\n\n\n\n\nApplication attributes\n\n\nOperator attributes\n\n\nPort attributes\n\n\n\n\nFor implementation details look at the \njavadocs\n. Some very common attributes are\n\n\n\n\nApplication: Application window, Application name, Checkpoint\n    window, Container JVM options, container memory, containers, max\n    count, heartbeat interval, STRAM memory, launch mode, tuple\n    recording, etc. \u00a0See \nContext.DAGContext\n\n\nOperators: Initial partitions, checkpoint window, locality\n    host, locality rack, memory, recovery attempts, stateless, storage\n    agent, etc. See \nContext.OperatorContext\n\n\nPorts: Queue capacity, auto_record, partition parallel, etc.\n    See \nContext.PortContext\n\n\n\n\nThese attributes are available via the \nContext\n class and can be\naccessed in the \nsetup\n call of an operator.\n\n\nApplication Configuration\n\n\nStarting from RTS release 2.0.0, applications are configured through Application Packages. \u00a0Please refer to the\n\nApplication Packages\n\u00a0for details.\n\n\nAdjusting Logging Levels\n\n\nApplication Logging\n\n\nLogging levels for specific classes or groups of classes can be raised or\nlowered at runtime from \ndtManage\n application view with the\n\nSet Log Levels\n button. \u00a0Explicit class paths or patterns like\n\norg.apache.hadoop.*\n\u00a0or \ncom.datatorrent.*\n\u00a0can be used to adjust logging to\nvalid \nlog4j\n levels such as DEBUG or INFO.\u00a0This produces immediate change in\nthe logs, but does not persist across application restarts.\n\n\nFor permanent changes to logging levels, lines similar to these can be inserted\ninto \ndt-site.xml\n. To specify multiple patterns, use a comma-separated list.\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.loggers.level\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ncom.datatorrent.*:DEBUG,org.apache.*:INFO\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nFull DEBUG logging can be enabled by adding these lines:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.attr.DEBUG\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ntrue\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom log4j Properties for Application Packages\n\n\nThere are two ways of setting custom \nlog4j\n properties in an Apex application\npackage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Application level. This will ensure that the custom log4j properties\n   are used for all containers including Application Master. An example:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.attr.CONTAINER_JVM_OPTIONS\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n-Dlog4j.configuration=custom_log4j.properties\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt an individual operator level. This sets the custom log4j properties only\n   on the container that is hosting the operator.  An example:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.operator.\nOPERATOR_NAME\n.attr.JVM_OPTIONS\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n -Dlog4j.configuration=custom_log4j.properties\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the file \ncustom_log4j.properties\n is part of your application\njar and is located under \nsrc/main/resources\n.  Some examples of custom log4j\nproperties files follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting to a file\n\n\nlog4j.rootLogger=${hadoop.root.logger} // this is set to INFO / DEBUG, RFA\nlog4j.appender.RFA=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender\nlog4j.appender.RFA.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.RFA.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} [%t] %-5p %c{2} %M - %m%n\nlog4j.appender.RFA.File=${hadoop.log.dir}/${hadoop.log.file}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting to Console\n\n\nlog4j.rootLogger=${hadoop.root.logger} // this is set to INFO / DEBUG, RFA\nlog4j.appender.RFA=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\nlog4j.appender.RFA.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} [%t] %-5p %c{2} %M - %m%n\nlog4j.appender.RFA.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndtGateway Logging\n\n\nDT Gateway log level can be changed to DEBUG by settings following\nenvironment variable before launching DT Gateway (as of version\n2.0).\n\n\nexport DT_GATEWAY_DEBUG=1\n\n\n\nHadoop Tuning\n\n\nYARN vmem-pmem ratio tuning\n\n\nAfter performing a new installation, sometimes the following\nmessage is displayed while launching an application:\n\n\nApplication application_1408120377110_0002 failed 2\ntimes due to AM Container for appattempt_1408120377110_0002_000002\nexited with exitCode: 143 due to:\nContainer\\[pid=27163,containerID=container_1408120377110_0002_02_000001\\]\nis running beyond virtual memory limits.

While designing an application,\nthe modes should be decided carefully. All\nstream-modes are hints to the STRAM, and hence could be ignored if\nresources are not available, and could be changed on a run-time basis.\nThere are pros and cons of each.   THREAD_LOCAL : All the operators of the ports on this stream\n    share the same thread. Tuples are thus passed via the thread call stack.\n    The performance is massive and go into 100s of millions\n    of tuples/sec. Do note that if the operations are compute intensive,\n    them THREAD_LOCAL may not perform better than CONTAINER_LOCAL.\n    Thread call stack is extremely efficient in terms of I/O (there is\n    no I/O here), but the same thread does both the upstream and\n    downstream computation. A limitation is that all downstream\n    operators on this stream must have only one input port connected. If\n    the JVM process is lost, all the operators are lost, and will be\n    restarted again in another container.  CONTAINER_LOCAL : All the operators of the ports on this\n    stream are in the same process. Each denotes a separate thread, and\n    tuples are passed in memory via a connectionBuffer as the intra-process\n    communication mechanism.\n    This mode has very high throughput and can easily do more than\n    million tuples/sec. However, since there is no bufferserver, features that\n    it provides (spooling, persistence) are not available, so memory needs\n    may grow.\n    This mode relies on the downstream operators consuming tuples, on average,\n    at least as fast as they are emitted by the upstream operator. As with the\n    previous mode, if the JVM process is\n    lost, all the operators are lost, and will be restarted again in\n    another container.  NODE_LOCAL : All operators on this stream are on the\n    same node. Inter-process communication via the local loopback interface is\n    used. This mode is also very fast, as data does not traverse the NIC\n    but it has a buffer-server and so all the features that the buffer-server\n    provides (spooling, persistence) are available. If one container dies, all\n    the operators in that container will obviously need to be recreated and\n    restarted, but other operators remain unaffected. However if\n    a node dies then all of its containers and the operators hosted by them\n    need to be restarted.  RACK_LOCAL : All operators on this stream are in the\n    same rack. Communication is not as fast as the previous modes since data\n    needs to pass through the NIC. Like the previous mode, it has a\n    buffer-server and so all the features that buffer-server provides are\n    available. Use of this mode reduces the probability of multi-operator\n    outage since multiple operators are not constrained to run on the same\n    node. This mode however will be affected by outage of a switch.  Unspecified: This is the default mode and STRAM makes no special effort\n    to achieve any particular locality.

            "text": "DataTorrent Gateway Security\n\n\nDataTorrent Gateway is a service that provides the backend functionality\nfor the DataTorrent UI Console and processes the web service requests from it. The service provides real-time information about running applications, allows changes to applications, launches new applications among various other operations. Refer to \ndtGateway\n for details on the Gateway service and \ndtManage\n\u00a0for the UI Console.\n\n\nBroadly security in Gateway can be classified into two categories, frontend security and backend security. Frontend security deals with access to Gateway service which mainly involves securing the web service calls. This includes aspects such as user authentication and authorization. The backend security deals with security aspects when Gateway is communicating with a secure Hadoop infrastructure.\n\n\nAfter installation of DataTorrent RTS both these aspects can be configured manually as described in the following sections although work is being done to enable this configuration in the UI Console during installation itself and post installation.\n\n\nKerberos Secure Mode\n\n\nKerberos is the de-facto authentication mechanism supported in Hadoop. When secure mode is enabled in Hadoop, requests from clients to Hadoop are authenticated using Kerberos. In this mode Gateway service needs Kerberos credentials to communicate with Hadoop. The credentials should match the user that the DT Gateway service is running under.\n\n\nIn a multi-user installation DT Gateway is typically running as\nuser \ndtadmin\n and the Kerberos credentials specified should be for this\nuser. They are specified in the \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file located in the config folder under the installation which is typically \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n ( or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for local install). For a single user installation where gateway is running as the user, the Kerberos credentials will be the user\u2019s credentials.\n\n\nThe snippet below shows how the credentials can be specified in the\nconfiguration file.\n\n\nproperty\n\n        \nname\ndt.gateway.authentication.principal\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nkerberos-principal-of-gateway-user\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\nproperty\n\n        \nname\ndt.gateway.authentication.keytab\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nabsolute-path-to-keytab-file\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nLong running applications\n\n\nIn secure mode, long running applications have additional requirements. Refer to the Token Refresh section in the Apache Apex security \ndocument\n.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nDataTorrent Gateway has support for authentication and when it is configured users have to authenticate before they can access the UI Console. Various authentication mechanisms are supported and this gives enterprises the flexibility to extend their existing authentication mechanism already in use within the enterprise to Gateway. It also supports roles, mapping of groups or roles from the external authentication mechanism to roles and supports role based authorization.\n\n\nThe different authentication mechanisms supported by Gateway are\n\n\n\n\nPassword Authentication\n\n\nLDAP Authentication\n\n\nKerberos Authentication\n\n\nJAAS Authentication\n for Active Directory, PAM, etc\n\n\n\n\nJAAS is a extensible authentication framework that supports different types of authentication mechanisms by plugging in an appropriate module.\n\n\nPassword Authentication\n\n\nPassword security is simple to set up and is ideal for a small to medium set of users. It comes with role-based access control, so users can be assigned roles, and roles can be assigned granular permissions (see \nUser Management\n). This is the only authentication mechanism available that does not depend on any external systems. The users will be managed locally by the Gateway. When enabled, all users will be presented with the login prompt before being able to use the DT Console.\n\n\nTo set up password security, on the \nSecurity Configuration\n page select \nPassword\n from the \nAuthentication Type\n dropdown, and save. Allow the Gateway to restart.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Gateway has restarted, you should be prompted for username and password. Log in as the default admin user \ndtadmin\n with password \ndtadmin\n.\n\n\n\n\nOnce authenticated, active username and an option to log out is presented in the top right corner of the DT Console screen.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional users and roles can be created and managed on the \nUser Management\n page.\n\n\nNote\n: Don't forget to change your \ndtadmin\n user's password!\n\n\nPassword Authentication via dt-site.xml\n\n\nPassword authentication can alternatively be configured outside the Console by performing following two steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a property to \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file, typically located\n    under \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n ( or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for local install).\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n...\n    \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.type\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\npassword\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway. If running Gateway in local mode use \ndtgateway restart\n instead.\n\n\nsudo service dtgateway restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP Authentication\n\n\nLDAP is a directory based authentication mechanism used in many enterprises. If your organization uses LDAP for authentication, the LDAP security option is ideal for giving your existing users access to RTS, with the role-based access control and group mapping features.\n\n\nThere are four variations for configuring LDAP authentication:\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n\n\nProvide the parent DN of your users and \nspecify the RDN attribute of users\n.\n\n\nUsers will authenticate using their RDN attribute value as their username.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous \n User Search Filter\n\n\nProvide the parent DN of your users and \nspecify a search filter to identify users\n.\n\n\nUsers will authenticate using an appropriate username that matches the parameters defined in the search filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity and Anonymous Search\n\n\nProvide the parent DN of your users, \nspecify the RDN attribute of users, and a search filter\n.\n\n\nUsers will authenticate using their RDN attribute value as their username, as well as the parameters defined in the search filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Anonymous Search with Group Support\n\n\nProvide basic DN info for users, DN and password of a user able to perform a non-anonymous search, and optional group support info.\n\n\nWith \ngroup support disabled\n, users need to be added in User Management before logging in. Users authenticate with their RDN attribute value as their username.\n\n\nWith \ngroup support enabled\n, users do not have to be added in User Management before logging in. Users authenticate with their RDN attribute value as their username. They will be assigned roles mapped to their LDAP group. For example, user Peter is part of GroupA (admin) and GroupB (developer, operator); Peter will be assigned roles admin, developer, and operator upon login.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen group support is not configured, users must be assigned a role before they are able to log in. This means users can be restricted from logging in (blacklisted) by removing all of their roles.\n\n\nNote\n: If migrating from \nPassword\n mode, the existing users will be carried over as \"local users\" and can still login as if in \nPassword\n mode. It is recommended to keep only the \ndtadmin\n user and delete the rest. This is because local users cannot be added or deleted once \nLDAP\n mode is activated.\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting up LDAP in the Security Configuration page, the \nLDAP Users\n section will appear in the User Management page. If you have group support enabled, the \nLDAP Groups\n section will also appear. Existing users (carried over from \nPassword\n mode), will be placed in the \nLocal Users\n sections. Local users cannot be added or deleted in LDAP mode, but their roles and passwords can be modified.\n\n\n\n\nTo configure LDAP via dt-site.xml, check out the \nJAAS Authentication - LDAP\n section below.\n\n\nKerberos Authentication\n\n\nKerberos authentication can optionally be enabled for Hadoop web access.\nWhen configured, all web browser access to Hadoop management consoles are Kerberos authenticated. Web services are also Kerberos authenticated. This authentication is performed using a protocol called SPNEGO which is Kerberos over HTTP.\nPlease refer to the administration guide of your Hadoop distribution on\nhow to enable this. The web browsers must also support SPNEGO, most\nmodern browsers do and should be configured to use SPNEGO for the\nspecific URLs being accessed. Please refer to the documentation of the\nindividual browsers on how to configure this. Gateway handles the SPNEGO\nauthentication needed when communicating with the Hadoop web-services if\nKerberos authentication is enabled for Hadoop web access.\n\n\nKerberos authentication can be enabled for UI Console as well. When it\nis enabled access to the Gateway web-services is Kerberos authenticated.\nThe browser should be configured for SPNEGO authentication when\naccessing the Console. A user typically obtains a master ticket first by logging in to kerberos system in a terminal emulator using kinit. Then, user launches a browser to access the Console URL. The browser\nwill use the master ticket obtained by kinit earlier to obtain the\nnecessary security tokens to authenticate with the Gateway.\n\n\nWhen this authentication is enabled the first authenticated user that\naccesses the system is assigned the admin role as there are no other\nusers in the system at this point. Any subsequent authenticated user\nthat access the system starts with no roles. The admin user can then\nassign roles to these users. This behavior can be changed by configuring\nan external role mapping. Please refer to the \nExternal Role Mapping\n in the \nAuthorization using external roles\n section below for that.\n\n\nAdditional configuration is needed to enable Kerberos authentication for\nthe Console. A separate set of kerberos credentials are needed. These\ncan be same as the Hadoop web-service Kerberos credentials which are\ntypically identified with the principal HTTP/HOST@DOMAIN. A few other\nconfiguration properties are also needed. These can be specified in the\nsame \u201cdt-site.xml\u201d configuration file as the DT Gateway authentication\nconfiguration described in the Operation and Installation Guide. This\nauthentication can be set up using the following steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following properties to \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file, typically located under \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n ( or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for local install)\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n...\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.type\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\nkerberos\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.kerberos.principal\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{kerberos-principal-of-web-service}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.kerberos.keytab\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{absolute-path-to-keytab-file}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.token.validity\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{authentication-token-validity-in-seconds}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.cookie.domain\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{http-cookie-domain-for-authentication-token}\n/value\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.cookie.path\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{http-cookie-path}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.signature.secret\n/name\n\n    \nvalue\n{absolute-path-of-secret-file-for-signing-authentication-tokens} \n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote that the kerberos principal for web service should begin with\nHTTP/\u2026  All the values for the properties above except for the property\n\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.type\n should be replaced with the\nappropriate values for your setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway by running\n\n\nsudo service dtgateway restart\n\n( when running Gateway in local mode use  \ndtgateway restart\n command)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJAAS Authentication\n\n\nJAAS or Java Authentication and Authorization Service is a pluggable\nand extensible mechanism for authentication. It is an authentication framework\nwhere the actual authentication is performed by a JAAS login module plugin which can be configured using a configuration file. \n\n\nThe general configuration steps for enabling any JAAS based authentication mechanism is described below. Subsequent sections will cover the specific configuration details for LDAP, Active Directory and PAM. However JAAS is not limited to just these three mechanisms. Any other JAAS compatible mechanism can be used by specifying the appropriate module in the configuration. Also if there isn't a JAAS module available for an authentication mechanism a new one can be developed using the JAAS API and used here.\n\n\nBelow are the general steps for configuring a JAAS authentication mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following properties to \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file, typically located under \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n (or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for local install).\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n  \nproperty\n\n      \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.type\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\njaas\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n      \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\nname-of-jaas-module\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n    ...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n property specifies the login module to use with JAAS and the next step explains the process for configuring it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the login module requires a custom callback handler it needs to be specified. What a callback handler is and how it can be specified is described in the next section \nCallback Handlers\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the login module specified above should be configured\n    with the appropriate settings for the plugin. This is module\n    specific configuration. This can be done in a file named\n    .java.login.config in the home directory of the user Gateway is\n    running under. If DataTorrent RTS was installed as a superuser,\n    Gateway would typically run as dtadmin and this file path would\n    typically be \n/home/dtadmin/.java.login.config\n, if running as a\n    regular user it would be \n~/.java.login.config\n. The sample\n    configurations for LDAP and PAM are shown in the next sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe classes for the login module may need to be made available to\n    Gateway if they are not available in the default classpath. This can\n    be done by specifying the jars containing these classes in a\n    classpath variable that is used by Gateway.\n\n\nThe following step shows how to do this\n\n\na.  Edit the \ncustom-env.sh\n configuration file, typically located under\n    \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n ( or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for\n    local install) and append the list of jars obtained above to the\n    DT_CLASSPATH variable. This needs to be added at the end of the\n    file in the section for specifying local overrides to environment\n    variables. The line would look like\n\n\nexport DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/jar1:path/to/jar2:..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway by running\n\n\nsudo service dtgateway restart\n\n(when running Gateway in local mode use  \ndtgateway restart\n command)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to Kerberos when this authentication is enabled the first\nauthenticated user that accesses the system is assigned the admin role\nas there are no other users in the system at this point. Any subsequent\nauthenticated user that access the system starts with no roles. The\nadmin user can then assign roles to these users. This behavior can be\nchanged by configuring an external role mapping. Please refer to the\n\nExternal Role Mapping\n in the \nAuthorization using external roles\n section below for that.  \n\n\nCallback Handlers\n\n\nIn JAAS authentication, a login module may need a custom callback to be\nhandled by the caller. These callbacks are typically used to provide\nauthentication credentials to the login module. DataTorrent RTS provides a default callback handler that handles the common callbacks but it may\nnot be sufficient for all login modules like in the Active Directory case described below.\n\n\nRTS also supports specification of a custom callback handler to handle custom callbacks of a login module. The custom callback handler can be specified using the property \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.callback.class.name\n and when this property is not specified the default callback handler is used. The property can be specified in the \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file and as follows\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n    \nproperty\n \n            \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.callback.class.name\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nfull-class-name-of-callback\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n    ...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom callback handlers can be implemented by extending the default callback handler so they get the support for the common callbacks or they can be implemented from scratch. The Jetty callback handler described below also extends the default callback handler. The default callback handler implementation is implemented in the \ncom.datatorrent.lib.security.auth.callback.DefaultCallbackHandler\n class available in \ncom.datatorrent:dt-library\n artifact.\n\n\nLDAP\n\n\nAn alternative way to enable LDAP authentication, instead of \nLDAP Authentication\n section above, is to follow the JAAS configuration steps described above with the following specific details for the individual steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 1 of the JAAS authentication \nconfiguration process\n, pick a name for the JAAS module for LDAP. You can choose a name like \nldap\n that is appropriate for the current scheme. This can be done by specifying the value of the \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n property to be \nldap\n. This name should now be configured with the appropriate settings as described in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 2, no special callback handler needs to be specified as the default callback handler can handle the callbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 3, the JAAS name specified above should be configured in the .java.login.config file with the appropriate LDAP settings. There are different JAAS authentication modules available for LDAP. One of them is supplied by default in Java. It is the Sun LdapLoginModule class. A sample configuration when using this module is shown below\n\n\nldap {\n  com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule required\n  userProvider=\"ldap://ldap-server-hostname\"\n  authIdentity=\"uid={USERNAME},ou=users,dc=domain,dc=com\";\n};\n\n\n\nNote that the first string before the open brace, in this case\n\nldap\n must match the jaas name specified in step 1. The first property\n\ncom.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule\n specifies\nthe actual JAAS plugin implementation class providing the LDAP\nauthentication. The fields that appear next are LDAP settings specific to your\norganization and could be different from ones shown above. The above\nsettings are only provided as a reference example.\n\n\nThe setting \nauthIdentity\n is used to derive the identity of the user that will be used for authentication with the server. Here it is specifying the pattern to derive the LDAP distinguished name (dn) for the user that will be used along with the password supplied by the user for authentication with the LDAP server. The \n{USERNAME}\n variable in the setting will be replaced by the username specified by the user. \n\n\nRefer to the \njavadoc\n for all the configuration options available with this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 4, no extra jars are needed as the module is available in Java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the gateway as described in step 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Directory\n\n\nActive Directory is used when authenting users in Microsoft Windows domains. The authentication protocol includes Microsoft's implementation of Kerberos as well as LDAP. In this section we will look into the configuration needed for LDAP authentication with Active Directory.\n\n\nFollow the JAAS configuration steps described above with the following specific details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 1 of the JAAS authentication \nconfiguration process\n, pick a name for the JAAS module. You can choose a name like \nad\n that is appropriate for the current scheme. This can be done by specifying the value of the \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n property to be \nad\n. This name should now be configured with the appropriate settings as described in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 2, no special callback handler needs to be specified as the default callback handler can handle the callbacks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 3, the JAAS name specified above should be configured with\n   the appropriate Active Directory settings in the .java.login.config file. \n\n\nIn active directory authentication the user id is typically specified as \nusername@domain\n and sometimes just \nusername\n. Once the user is authenticated the user id needs to be mapped to the LDAP node for the user. This is done by specifying a search filter criteria which is then used to search for the user node in the directory tree starting from a specified base.\n\n\nBelow is an example showing a sample configuration for active directory authentication with the Sun LdapLoginModule\n\n\nad {\n    com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule required\n    userProvider=\"ldap://ad.server.com/cn=users,dc=domain,dc=com\"\n    userFilter=\"samAccountName={USERNAME}\"\n    authIdentity=\"{USERNAME}@my.domain.com\";\n};\n\n\n\nThe setting \nuserFilter\n specifies the search criteria to look for the user in the Active Directory tree. The \n{USERNAME}\n variable in the setting is replaced with the username supplied by the user. The setting \nauthIdentity\n specifies the pattern to derive the user id with the domain from the specified username.\n\n\nThe search filter can have more complex logical expressions like the one shown below\n\n\nuserFilter=\"(\n(|(samAccountName={USERNAME})(userPrincipalName={USERNAME})(cn={USERNAME}))(objectClass=user))\"\n\n\n\nAn Active Directory or a LDAP browser client can be used to browse the Active Directory to determine the correct filter to use find the users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 4, no extra jars are needed as the module is available in Java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the gateway as described in step 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJetty module \n binding\n\n\nSometimes a single \nauthIdentity\n pattern like the one used above cannot be used to identity the users because of the way they are configured in the Active Directory, for an enterprise. An example is the case where multiple domains are being used and a single domain name cannot be specified in the \nauthIdentity\n. \n\n\nIn those cases a fixed identity called the root identity or a system identity is used to connect to the server. Then the user node is searched with the search criteria and supplied username, from the node the user directory name is extracted and it is used along with the supplied password for the authentication.\n\n\nA different JAAS login module that supports the system identity is needed as the Sun LdapLoginModule does not support this functionality. Jetty implements one such login module. The steps to configure this module are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 1 of the JAAS authentication \nconfiguration process\n, the name \nad\n can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 2, a special callback handler is needed to handle the Jetty module callbacks as they are not the common callbacks. There is an implementation of the callback handler for Jetty that is provided by DataTorrent RTS. It is the \ncom.datatorrent.contrib.security.jetty.JettyJAASCallbackHandler\n class in the \ncom.datatorrent:dt-contrib\n artifact.\n\n\nAs explained in the \nCallback Handlers\n section above, the callback handler can be specified in the \ndt-site.xml\n config file using a property as shown below\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n    \nproperty\n \n        \nname\n\n            dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.callback.class.name\n    \n/name\n\n        \nvalue\n\n            com.datatorrent.contrib.security.jetty.JettyJAASCallbackHandler\n        \n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n    ...  \n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 3, the configuration for the Jetty module is specified in the \n.java.login.config\n file. A sample configuration for this module is shown below\n\n\nad {\n    org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jaas.spi.LdapLoginModule required\n    contextFactory=\"com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\"\n    hostname=\"ad.server.com\"\n    port=\"389\"\n    bindDn=\"serviceId@my.domain.com\"\n    bindPassword=\"Password1\"\n    forceBindingLogin=\"true\"\n    userBaseDn=\"DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com\"\n    userIdAttribute=\"samAccountName\"\n    userObjectClass=\"person\";\n};\n\n\n\nThe property \norg.eclipse.jetty.plus.jaas.spi.LdapLoginModule\n specifies\nthe actual JAAS plugin implementation class providing the LDAP authentication. The properties \nbindDn\n and \nbindPassword\n specify the directory name and password for the system identity respectively. The \nuserIdAttribute\n and \nuserObjectClass\n settings are used as search criteria to search for the user directory node under the \nuserBaseDn\n path in the directory.\n\n\nRefer to the \njavadoc\n for all the configuration options available with this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway service in DataTorrent RTS 3.0 is compatible with Jetty 8. The Jetty login module in this version is in the \njetty-plus\n jar. The following version \njetty-plus-8.1.10.v20130312.jar\n is known to work but other compatible versions should work as well. The jar file can be obtained from the Jetty project or from \nmaven central\n. \n\n\nAlong with the jetty jar the dt-contrib jar containing the callback handler and it's dependencies should also be included. It is available on the DataTorrent maven server \nhere\n.  Pick the version matching the DataTorrent RTS version you are using. The dt-contrib artifact has a dependency to \ncom.datatorrent:dt-library\n artifact. It is also available on the maven server \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe jars can be specified in the gateway script file described in step 4 above as follows\n\n\nexport DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/jetty-plus-8.1.10.v20130312.jar:path/to/dt-contrib-\nversion\n.jar:path/to/dt-library-\nversion\n.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the gateway as described in step 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAM\n\n\nPAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) is a Linux system equivalent\nof JAAS where applications call the generic PAM interface and the actual\nauthentication implementations called PAM modules are specified using\nconfiguration files. PAM is the login authentication mechanism in Linux\nso it can be used for example to authenticate and use local Linux user\naccounts in Gateway. If organizations have configured other PAM modules, \nthey can be used in Gateway as well.\n\n\nPAM is implemented in C language and has a C API. JPam is a Java PAM bridge\nthat uses JNI to interface with PAM. It is available at\n\nJPAM website\n and the website also has detailed documentation on how to install and set it up. JPam has a JAAS login module and hence can be used in Gateway via JAAS. Note that any other PAM implementation can be used as long as a JAAS login module is available.\n\n\nTo enable JPAM follow the JAAS configuration steps described above with the following specific details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPAM has to be first installed on the system. Please follow the\n    installation instructions from the JPAM website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 1 of the JAAS authentication \nconfiguration process\n, pick a name for the JPAM authentication module. You can choose a  name like \nnet-sf-jpam\n which JPAM typically uses as the PAM configuration name. This can be done by specifying the value of the \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n property to be \nnet-sf-jpam\n. This name should now be configured with the appropriate settings as described in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 2, no special callback handler needs to be specified as the default callback handler can handle the callbacks \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 3, the JAAS name specified above should be configured in the .java.login.config file with the appropriate JPAM settings . A\n    sample configuration is shown below\n\n\nnet-sf-jpam {\n   net.sf.jpam.jaas.JpamLoginModule required serviceName=\"net-sf-jpam\";\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the first string before the open brace, in this case,\n\nnet-sf-jpam\n must match the jaas name specified in step 1. The first\nproperty within the braces net.sf.jpam.jaas.JpamLoginModule specifies\nthe actual JAAS plugin implementation class providing the JPAM\nauthentication. The next settings are JPAM related settings. The setting \nserviceName\n specifies the PAM service which would need to be further configured in /etc/pam.d/net-sf-jpam to specify the PAM modules to use. Refer to PAM documentation on how to configure a PAM service with PAM modules. If using Linux local accounts system-auth could be specified as the PAM module in this file. The above settings are only provided as a reference example and a different name can be chosen for \nserviceName\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor step 4, add the JPam jar to the DT_CLASSPATH variable. The JPam\n    jar should be available in the JPam installation package and\n    typically has the filename format \nJPam-\nversion\n.jar\n where\n   \nversion\n denotes the version, version 1.1 has been tested.\n\n\nexport DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/JPam-\nversion\n.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the gateway as described in step 5 above    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Support\n\n\nFor group support such as using LDAP groups for authorization refer to\nthe \nAuthorization using external roles\n section below.\n\n\nHadoop user mapping\n\n\nWhen authentication is enabled, applications are launched on the Hadoop cluster, by default, as the user matching the user name of the authenticated user. This mapping behavior, to select the user to use on the Hadoop side, is configurable and different options are available. To configure the behavior use the following setting\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.gateway.hadoop.user.strategy\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\nSTRATEGY\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSTRATEGY\n in the property above identifies the mapping behavior and the following options are available\n\n\nAuthenticated user\n\n\nTo specify this behavior, use \nAUTH_USER\n as the value for \nSTRATEGY\n. As explained earlier, this leads to applications being launched with the same user name as the authenticated user. This is the default behavior even when the property is not specified.\n\n\nIn Kerberos secure mode, DT Gateway would still connect to Hadoop by using its Kerberos credentials, namely credentials of the user the DT Gateway service is running under (default \ndtadmin\n) but impersonate the authenticated user, to launch the application. This impersonation requires additional configuration on Hadoop side and it is explained in the Hadoop Configuration sub-section under the Impersonation section in the Apache Apex security \ndocument\n.\n\n\nGateway user\n\n\nTo specify this behavior, use \nGATEWAY_USER\n as the value for \nSTRATEGY\n. In this mode, the Hadoop user is the same as the DT Gateway service user (default \ndtadmin\n) and no impersonation is necessary.\n\n\nSpecified user\n\n\nTo specify this behavior, use \nSPECIFIED_USER\n as the value for \nSTRATEGY\n. In this mode, a specific user name can be specified for the Hadoop user and it is used no matter who the authenticated user is. The Hadoop user name is specified by an additional property\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.gateway.hadoop.user.name\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\nusername\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impersonation behavior described in the \nAuthenticated user\n section above applies here as well and so do the requirements mentioned there.\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n\nWhen any authentication method is enabled, authorization will also be\nenabled.  DT Gateway uses roles and permissions for authorization.\n Permissions are possession of the authority to perform certain actions,\ne.g. to launch apps, or to add users.  Roles have a collection of\npermissions and individual users are assigned to one or more roles.\n What roles the user is in dictates what permissions the user has.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nThe list of all possible permissions in the DT Gateway is as follow:\n\n\nACCESS_RM_PROXY\n\n\nAllow HTTP proxying requests to YARN\u2019s Resource Manager REST API\n\n\nEDIT_GLOBAL_CONFIG\n\n\nEdit global settings\n\n\nEDIT_OTHER_USERS_CONFIG\n\n\nEdit other users\u2019 settings\n\n\nLAUNCH_APPS\n\n\nLaunch Apps\n\n\nMANAGE_LICENSES\n\n\nManage DataTorrent RTS licenses\n\n\nMANAGE_OTHER_USERS_APPS\n\n\nManage (e.g. edit, kill, etc) applications launched by other users\n\n\nMANAGE_OTHER_USERS_APP_PACKAGES\n\n\nManage App Packages uploaded by other users  \n\n\nMANAGE_ROLES\n\n\nManage roles (create/delete roles, or assign permissions to roles)\n\n\nMANAGE_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nManage system alerts\n\n\nMANAGE_USERS\n\n\nManage users (create/delete users, change password)\n\n\nUPLOAD_APP_PACKAGES\n\n\nUpload App Packages and use the app builder\n\n\nVIEW_GLOBAL_CONFIG\n\n\nView global settings   \n\n\nVIEW_LICENSES\n\n\nView DataTorrent RTS licenses\n\n\nVIEW_OTHER_USERS_APPS\n\n\nView applications launched by others\n\n\nVIEW_OTHER_USERS_APP_PACKAGES\n\n\nView App Packages uploaded by other users\n\n\nVIEW_OTHER_USERS_CONFIG\n\n\nEdit other users\u2019 settings\n\n\nVIEW_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nView system alerts\n\n\nDefault Roles\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS ships with three roles by default. The permissions for\nthese roles have been set accordingly but can be customized if needed.\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\nAn administrator of DataTorrent RTS is intended to be able to install,\nmanage \n modify DataTorrent RTS as well as all the applications running\non it. They have ALL the permissions.\n\n\nOperator\n\n\nOperators are intended to ensure DataTorrent RTS and the applications\nrunning on top of it are always up and running optimally. The default\npermissions assigned to Operators, enable them to effectively\ntroubleshoot the entire RTS system and the applications running on it.\nOperators are not allowed however to develop or launch new applications.\nOperators are also not allowed to make system configuration changes or\nmanage users.\n\n\nHere is the list of default permissions given to operators\n\n\nMANAGE_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nVIEW_GLOBAL_CONFIG\n\n\nVIEW_LICENSES\n\n\nVIEW_OTHER_USERS_APPS\n\n\nVIEW_OTHER_USERS_APP_PACKAGES\n\n\nVIEW_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nNote that VIEW_OTHER_USERS_APPS and VIEW_OTHER_USERS_APP_PACKAGES\nare in the list.  This means all users in the \u201coperator\u201d role will have\nread access to all apps and all app packages in the system.  You can\nremove those permissions from the \u201coperator\u201d role using the Console if\nthis is not desirable.  \n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\nDevelopers need to have to ability to develop, manage and run\napplications on DataTorrent RTS. They are not allowed to change any\nsystem settings or manage licenses.\n\n\nHere is the list of default permissions given to developers\n\n\nLAUNCH_APPS\n\n\nUPLOAD_APP_PACKAGES\n\n\nMANAGE_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nVIEW_GLOBAL_CONFIG\n\n\nVIEW_LICENSES\n\n\nVIEW_SYSTEM_ALERTS\n\n\nApp Permissions and App Package Permissions\n\n\nUsers can share their running application instances and their\napplication packages with certain roles or certain users on a\nper-instance or per-package basis.  Users can specify which users or\nwhile roles have read-only or read-write access.  In addition, users can\nset their own defaults so they does not have to make permission change\nevery time they launch an app or uploads an app package.\n\n\nThe default for app and app package sharing is that the \u201coperator\u201d role\nhas read-only permission.\n\n\nThe Console does not yet support managing App\nPermissions or App Package Permissions.  But one can manage App\nPermissions and App Package Permissions using the Gateway REST API with\nURI\u2019s /ws/v2/apps/{appid}/permissions and\n/ws/v2/appPackages/{user}/{name}/permissions respectively.  Please refer\nto the \nDT Gateway REST API document\n and \nhere\n for examples on how to use the REST API.\n\n\nViewing and Managing Auth in the Console\n\n\nViewing User Profile\n\n\nAfter you are logged in on the Console, click on the Configuration tab\non the left, and select \u201cUser Profile\u201d.  This gives you the information\nof the logged in user, including what roles the user is in, and what\npermissions the user has.\n\n\n\nAdministering Auth\n\n\nFrom the Configuration tab, click on \u201cAuth Management\u201d.  On this page,\nyou can perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate new users\n\n\nDelete users\n\n\nChange existing users\u2019 passwords\n\n\nAssign roles to users\n\n\nCreate roles\n\n\nAssign permissions to roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS installation comes with three preset roles (admin,\noperator, and developer).  You can edit the permissions for those roles\nexcept for admin.\n\n\nAuthorization using external roles\n\n\nWhen using an external authentication mechanism such as Kerberos or\nJAAS, roles defined in these external systems can be used to control\nauthorization in DataTorrent RTS. There are two steps involved. First\nsupport for external roles has to be configured in Gateway. This is\ndescribed below in the sections \nKerberos roles\n and\n\nJAAS roles\n. Then a mapping should be specified between\nthe external roles and DataTorrent roles to specify which role should be\nused for a user when the user logs in. How to setup this mapping is\ndescribed in the \nExternal Role Mapping\n section below.\nWhen this mapping is setup only users with roles that have a mapping are\nallowed to login the rest are not. The next sections describe how to\nconfigure the system for handling external roles.\n\n\nKerberos roles\n\n\nWhen Kerberos authentication is used the role for the user is derived\nfrom the principal. If the principal is of the form \nuser/group@DOMAIN\n\nthe group portion is used as the external role and no additional\nconfiguration is necessary.\n\n\nJAAS roles\n\n\nTo use JAAS roles the system should be configured first to recognize\nthese roles. When a user is authenticated with JAAS a list of principals\nis returned for the user by the JAAS plugin login module. If the module supports roles then some of these principals are for roles and these role principals need to be identified from the list. Additional configuration is needed to do\nthis and it is specific to the login module implementation. Specifically the Java class name identifying the role principal is needed. This can be specified using the \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.role.class.name\n property in the \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file as shown below\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.role.class.name\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nfull-class-name-of-role\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n    ...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP Groups\n\n\nWhen using LDAP with JAAS, to utilize the LDAP roles, a LDAP login module supporting roles should be used. Any LDAP module that supports roles can be used. Jetty login module has support for roles. Refer to \nJetty module \n binding\n section above for more details about this module. The configuration steps are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jetty login module returns the roles in role principal classes. The class name identifying the role is \norg.eclipse.jetty.plus.jaas.JAASRole\n. This should be specified using the \ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.role.class.name\n property in the \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file as described in the section above. \n\n\nAlso as described in the \nJetty module \n binding\n section a custom callback handler is needed for the Jetty login module.\n\n\nA sample configuration file with all the properties is shown below\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n...\n  \nproperty\n\n          \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.type\n/name\n\n          \nvalue\njaas\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n         \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name\n/name\n\n         \nvalue\nldap\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n  \n        \nname\ndt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.role.class.name\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\norg.eclipse.jetty.plus.jaas.JAASRole\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \n/property\n\n        \nname\n\n                dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.callback.class.name\n        \n/name\n\n        \nvalue\n\n            com.datatorrent.contrib.security.jetty.JettyJAASCallbackHandler\n        \n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the system identity is used then the Jetty login module can be used as is and the jar dependencies in the step below can be specified as described in the \nJetty module \n binding\n section. \n\n\nHowever, if system identity is not used something different needs to be done. An issue was discovered with the Jetty login module supplied with Jetty 8 that prevented LDAP authentication to be successful even when the user credentials were correct. DataTorrent has a fix for this and is providing the login module with the fix in a separate package called \ndt-auth\n. The class name for the module is \ncom.datatorrent.auth.jetty.JettyLdapLoginModule\n. The \ndt-auth\n project along with the source can be found here \nAuth\n. DataTorrent is working on submitting this fix back to Jetty project so that it gets back into the main source.\n\n\nThe JAAS configuration file as described in \nLDAP\n section under \nEnabling JAAS Auth\n should be configured to specify the ldap settings for roles. A sample configuration containing role settings for the \ndt-auth\n login module is shown below. \n\n\nldap {\n    com.datatorrent.auth.jetty.JettyLdapLoginModule required\n    hostname=\"ldap-server-hostname\" port=\"389\"\n    authenticationMethod=\"simple\" \n    userBaseDn=\"ou=users,dc=domain,dc=com\" userIdAttribute=\"uid\"\n    userRdnAttribute=\"uid\" roleBaseDn=\"ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=com\"\n    roleNameAttribute=\"cn\"\n    contextFactory=\"com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\";\n};\n\n\n\nThe \nroleNameAttribute\n and \nroleBaseDn\n settings are used to identify the role and the \nuserRdnAttribute\n setting is used the identify the users that belong to the role. The values for these settings are dependent on attributes names are being used in your LDAP directory server.\n\n\nSimilar configuration can be used when the original Jetty login module is being used with the system id, the module class would be Jetty login module class and the binding settings would be specified as described in the \nJetty module \n binding\n section.\n\n\nRefer to the \njavadoc\n for the role and other configuration options available with this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Jetty login module is being used as is then the path specification instructions described in the \nJetty module \n binding\n section can be used. \n\n\nIf the login module containing the DataTorrent fix, dt-auth, is being used then it's jar along with the Jetty module dependencies containing the role class, the dt-contrib jar containing the custom callback handler along with its dependencies should all be made available for Gateway. The jars can be obtained from the \nDataTorrent Auth\n project.\n\n\nPlease follow the instructions in the above url to obtain the project jar files. After obtaining the jar files they can be specified in the gateway script file as\n\n\nexport DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/jar1:path/to/jar2:..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway as described earlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Role Mapping\n\n\nExternal role mapping is specified to map the external roles to the\nDataTorrent roles. For example users from an LDAP group called admins\nshould have the admin role when using the Console. This can be specified\nby doing the following steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the configuration folder typically located under\n    \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n ( or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for\n    local install) edit the file called external-roles or create the\n    file if it not already present. In this file each line contains a\n    mapping from an external role to a datatorrent role separated by a\n    delimiter \u2018:\u2019 An example listing is\n\n\nadmins:admin\nstaff:developer\n\n\n\nThis maps the external role admins to the DataTorrent role admin and\nexternal role staff to the DataTorrent role developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway as described earlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministering Using Command Line\n\n\nYou can also utilize the \ndtGateway REST API\n (under /ws/v2/auth) to add or remove users and to change roles and passwords.\n Here are the examples with password authentication.\n\n\nLog in as admin:\n\n\n% curl -c ~/cookie-jar -XPOST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"userName\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"admin\"}' http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/login\n\n\n\nThis curl command logs in as user \u201cadmin\u201d (with the default password\n\u201cadmin\u201d) and stores the cookie in ~/cookie-jar\n\n\nChanging the admin password:\n\n\n% curl -b ~/cookie-jar -XPOST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"newPassword\":\"xyz\"}' http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users/admin\n\n\n\nThis uses the \u201cadmin\u201d credential from the cookie jar to change the password to \u201cxyz\u201d for user \u201cadmin\u201d.\n\n\nAdding a second admin user:\n\n\n% curl -b ~/cookie-jar -XPUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"password\":\"abc\",\"roles\": [ \"admin\" ] }' http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users/john\n\n\n\nThis command adds a user \u201cjohn\u201d with password \u201cabc\u201d with admin access.\n\n\nAdding a user in the developer role:\n\n\n% curl -b \\~/cookie-jar -XPUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"password\":\"abc\",\"roles\": [\"developer\"] (http://localhost:9090/ws/v1/login) }' http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users/jane\n\n\n\nThis command adds a user \u201cjane\u201d with password \u201cabc\u201d with the developer role.\n\n\nListing all users:\n\n\n% curl -b ~/cookie-jar http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users\n\n\n\nGetting info for a specific user:\n\n\n% curl -b ~/cookie-jar http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users/john\n\n\n\nThis command returns the information about the user \u201cjohn\u201d.\n\n\nRemoving a user:\n\n\n% curl -b ~/cookie-jar -XDELETE http://localhost:9090/ws/v2/auth/users/jane\n\n\n\nThis command removes the user \u201cjane\u201d.\n\n\nSetting up SSL Keystore in Gateway\n\n\nAn SSL keystore is needed for your gateway to enable HTTPS in the gateway and to configure SMTP with password authentication. SMTP configuration is needed for the gateway to \nsend email alerts as described in \nSystem Alerts\n. \n\n\nFollow the steps below to set up the keystore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate an SSL keystore if you don\u2019t have one.  Instruction on how to generate an SSL keystore is here: \nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/ggfen/index.html\n.\nNote down the keystore password and full path of the keystore that you need to provide in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd two properties to \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file, typically located under \n/opt/datatorrent/current/conf\n (or \n~/datatorrent/current/conf\n for local install).\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n...\n  \nproperty\n\n    \n!-- this is the full path to the SSL keystore you created --\n\n      \nname\ndt.gateway.sslKeystorePath\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\n{/path/to/keystore}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n  \nproperty\n\n    \n!-- this is the keystore password --\n\n      \nname\ndt.gateway.sslKeystorePassword\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\n{keystore-password}\n/value\n\n  \n/property\n\n...\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform any additional steps required for \"Enabling HTTPS\" or \"SMTP Password Encryption\" use-case as described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the Gateway by running\n\n\nsudo service dtgateway restart\n\n\n\n(when running Gateway in local mode use \ndtgateway restart\n command)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling HTTPS in Gateway\n\n\nTo enable HTTPS in the Gateway after setting up the keystore as described above, you have to add the following\nproperty to the \ndt-site.xml\n configuration file\n\n\n    \nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n      \nproperty\n\n        \nname\ndt.attr.GATEWAY_USE_SSL\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\ntrue\n/value\n\n      \n/property\n\n    ...\n    \n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a Key for SMTP Password Encryption\n\n\nAdd another key to the keystore created above using the instructions mentioned in \nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/ggfen/index.html\n. For example:\n\n\nkeytool -genkey -alias smtpenc-alias -keyalg RSA -keypass \nkey password\n -storepass \nstore password\n -keystore gwkeystore.jks\n\n\n\n\nNote down the alias you used for the key (smtpenc-alias in the above command). Remember to use the same key password and \nstore password as the ones you used in the previous command where you created the keystore.\n\n\nAdd the following property to \ndt-site.xml\n to indicate the alias to be used for SMTP Password Encryption:\n\n\n    \nconfiguration\n\n    ...\n     \nproperty\n\n       \nname\ndt.gateway.ssl.alias.password.encryption\n/name\n\n       \nvalue\nsmtpenc-alias\n/value\n\n     \n/property\n\n    ...\n    \n/configuration",

Users will authenticate using their RDN attribute value as their username.    Anonymous   User Search Filter  Provide the parent DN of your users and  specify a search filter to identify users .  Users will authenticate using an appropriate username that matches the parameters defined in the search filter.    Identity and Anonymous Search  Provide the parent DN of your users,  specify the RDN attribute of users, and a search filter .  Users will authenticate using their RDN attribute value as their username, as well as the parameters defined in the search filter.    Non-Anonymous Search with Group Support  Provide basic DN info for users, DN and password of a user able to perform a non-anonymous search, and optional group support info.  With  group support disabled , users need to be added in User Management before logging in. Users authenticate with their RDN attribute value as their username.  With  group support enabled , users do not have to be added in User Management before logging in. Users authenticate with their RDN attribute value as their username. They will be assigned roles mapped to their LDAP group. For example, user Peter is part of GroupA (admin) and GroupB (developer, operator); Peter will be assigned roles admin, developer, and operator upon login.     When group support is not configured, users must be assigned a role before they are able to log in. This means users can be restricted from logging in (blacklisted) by removing all of their roles.  Note : If migrating from  Password  mode, the existing users will be carried over as \"local users\" and can still login as if in  Password  mode. It is recommended to keep only the  dtadmin  user and delete the rest. This is because local users cannot be added or deleted once  LDAP  mode is activated.   After setting up LDAP in the Security Configuration page, the  LDAP Users  section will appear in the User Management page.

It is an authentication framework\nwhere the actual authentication is performed by a JAAS login module plugin which can be configured using a configuration file.   The general configuration steps for enabling any JAAS based authentication mechanism is described below. Subsequent sections will cover the specific configuration details for LDAP, Active Directory and PAM. However JAAS is not limited to just these three mechanisms. Any other JAAS compatible mechanism can be used by specifying the appropriate module in the configuration. Also if there isn't a JAAS module available for an authentication mechanism a new one can be developed using the JAAS API and used here.

If the login module requires a custom callback handler it needs to be specified. What a callback handler is and how it can be specified is described in the next section  Callback Handlers .    The name of the login module specified above should be configured\n    with the appropriate settings for the plugin. This is module\n    specific configuration. This can be done in a file named\n    .java.login.config in the home directory of the user Gateway is\n    running under. If DataTorrent RTS was installed as a superuser,\n    Gateway would typically run as dtadmin and this file path would\n    typically be  /home/dtadmin/.java.login.config , if running as a\n    regular user it would be  ~/.java.login.config . The sample\n    configurations for LDAP and PAM are shown in the next sections.    The classes for the login module may need to be made available to\n    Gateway if they are not available in the default classpath. This can\n    be done by specifying the jars containing these classes in a\n    classpath variable that is used by Gateway.  The following step shows how to do this  a.  Edit the  custom-env.sh  configuration file, typically located under\n     /opt/datatorrent/current/conf  ( or  ~/datatorrent/current/conf  for\n    local install) and append the list of jars obtained above to the\n    DT_CLASSPATH variable. This needs to be added at the end of the\n    file in the section for specifying local overrides to environment\n    variables. The line would look like  export DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/jar1:path/to/jar2:..    Restart the Gateway by running  sudo service dtgateway restart \n(when running Gateway in local mode use   dtgateway restart  command)    Similar to Kerberos when this authentication is enabled the first\nauthenticated user that accesses the system is assigned the admin role\nas there are no other users in the system at this point. Any subsequent\nauthenticated user that access the system starts with no roles. The\nadmin user can then assign roles to these users. This behavior can be\nchanged by configuring an external role mapping. Please refer to the External Role Mapping  in the  Authorization using external roles  section below for that.",

For step 1 of the JAAS authentication  configuration process , pick a name for the JAAS module for LDAP. You can choose a name like  ldap  that is appropriate for the current scheme. This can be done by specifying the value of the  dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name  property to be  ldap .

For step 3, the JAAS name specified above should be configured in the .java.login.config file with the appropriate LDAP settings. There are different JAAS authentication modules available for LDAP. One of them is supplied by default in Java. It is the Sun LdapLoginModule class.

In this section we will look into the configuration needed for LDAP authentication with Active Directory.  Follow the JAAS configuration steps described above with the following specific details.    For step 1 of the JAAS authentication  configuration process , pick a name for the JAAS module. You can choose a name like  ad  that is appropriate for the current scheme. This can be done by specifying the value of the  dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.name  property to be  ad . This name should now be configured with the appropriate settings as described in the next step.    For step 2, no special callback handler needs to be specified as the default callback handler can handle the callbacks.     For step 3, the JAAS name specified above should be configured with\n   the appropriate Active Directory settings in the .java.login.config file.   In active directory authentication the user id is typically specified as  username@domain  and sometimes just  username . Once the user is authenticated the user id needs to be mapped to the LDAP node for the user. This is done by specifying a search filter criteria which is then used to search for the user node in the directory tree starting from a specified base.  Below is an example showing a sample configuration for active directory authentication with the Sun LdapLoginModule  ad {\n    com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule required\n    userProvider=\"ldap://ad.server.com/cn=users,dc=domain,dc=com\"\n    userFilter=\"samAccountName={USERNAME}\"\n    authIdentity=\"{USERNAME}@my.domain.com\";\n};  The setting  userFilter  specifies the search criteria to look for the user in the Active Directory tree. The  {USERNAME}  variable in the setting is replaced with the username supplied by the user. The setting  authIdentity  specifies the pattern to derive the user id with the domain from the specified username.  The search filter can have more complex logical expressions like the one shown below  userFilter=\"( (|(samAccountName={USERNAME})(userPrincipalName={USERNAME})(cn={USERNAME}))(objectClass=user))\"  An Active Directory or a LDAP browser client can be used to browse the Active Directory to determine the correct filter to use find the users.

An example is the case where multiple domains are being used and a single domain name cannot be specified in the  authIdentity .   In those cases a fixed identity called the root identity or a system identity is used to connect to the server. Then the user node is searched with the search criteria and supplied username, from the node the user directory name is extracted and it is used along with the supplied password for the authentication.  A different JAAS login module that supports the system identity is needed as the Sun LdapLoginModule does not support this functionality. Jetty implements one such login module. The steps to configure this module are as follows.    For step 1 of the JAAS authentication  configuration process , the name  ad  can be used.    For step 2, a special callback handler is needed to handle the Jetty module callbacks as they are not the common callbacks. There is an implementation of the callback handler for Jetty that is provided by DataTorrent RTS. It is the  com.datatorrent.contrib.security.jetty.JettyJAASCallbackHandler  class in the  com.datatorrent:dt-contrib  artifact.  As explained in the  Callback Handlers  section above, the callback handler can be specified in the  dt-site.xml  config file using a property as shown below  configuration \n    ...\n     property  \n         name \n            dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.callback.class.name\n     /name \n         value \n            com.datatorrent.contrib.security.jetty.JettyJAASCallbackHandler\n         /value \n     /property \n    ...   /configuration     For step 3, the configuration for the Jetty module is specified in the  .java.login.config  file.

The properties  bindDn  and  bindPassword  specify the directory name and password for the system identity respectively. The  userIdAttribute  and  userObjectClass  settings are used as search criteria to search for the user directory node under the  userBaseDn  path in the directory.  Refer to the  javadoc  for all the configuration options available with this module.    The Gateway service in DataTorrent RTS 3.0 is compatible with Jetty 8. The Jetty login module in this version is in the  jetty-plus  jar. The following version  jetty-plus-8.1.10.v20130312.jar  is known to work but other compatible versions should work as well.

JPam is a Java PAM bridge\nthat uses JNI to interface with PAM. It is available at JPAM website  and the website also has detailed documentation on how to install and set it up.

The Jetty login module returns the roles in role principal classes. The class name identifying the role is  org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jaas.JAASRole . This should be specified using the  dt.gateway.http.authentication.jaas.role.class.name  property in the  dt-site.xml  configuration file as described in the section above.

However, if system identity is not used something different needs to be done. An issue was discovered with the Jetty login module supplied with Jetty 8 that prevented LDAP authentication to be successful even when the user credentials were correct. DataTorrent has a fix for this and is providing the login module with the fix in a separate package called  dt-auth . The class name for the module is  com.datatorrent.auth.jetty.JettyLdapLoginModule . The  dt-auth  project along with the source can be found here  Auth . DataTorrent is working on submitting this fix back to Jetty project so that it gets back into the main source.  The JAAS configuration file as described in  LDAP  section under  Enabling JAAS Auth  should be configured to specify the ldap settings for roles. A sample configuration containing role settings for the  dt-auth  login module is shown below.   ldap {\n    com.datatorrent.auth.jetty.JettyLdapLoginModule required\n    hostname=\"ldap-server-hostname\" port=\"389\"\n    authenticationMethod=\"simple\" \n    userBaseDn=\"ou=users,dc=domain,dc=com\" userIdAttribute=\"uid\"\n    userRdnAttribute=\"uid\" roleBaseDn=\"ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=com\"\n    roleNameAttribute=\"cn\"\n    contextFactory=\"com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory\";\n};  The  roleNameAttribute  and  roleBaseDn  settings are used to identify the role and the  userRdnAttribute  setting is used the identify the users that belong to the role. The values for these settings are dependent on attributes names are being used in your LDAP directory server.  Similar configuration can be used when the original Jetty login module is being used with the system id, the module class would be Jetty login module class and the binding settings would be specified as described in the  Jetty module   binding  section.  Refer to the  javadoc  for the role and other configuration options available with this module.    If the Jetty login module is being used as is then the path specification instructions described in the  Jetty module   binding  section can be used.   If the login module containing the DataTorrent fix, dt-auth, is being used then it's jar along with the Jetty module dependencies containing the role class, the dt-contrib jar containing the custom callback handler along with its dependencies should all be made available for Gateway. The jars can be obtained from the  DataTorrent Auth  project.  Please follow the instructions in the above url to obtain the project jar files. After obtaining the jar files they can be specified in the gateway script file as  export DT_CLASSPATH=${DT_CLASSPATH}:path/to/jar1:path/to/jar2:..    Restart the Gateway as described earlier",

            "text": "DT Gateway System Alerts\n\n\nThe DT Gateway allows the user to create system alerts using JavaScript expressions.\nValues in the expressions can come from PubSub websocket topics and include values\nlike system metrics, application metrics, and custom application counters.\nAlert configurations are stored in the Hadoop cluster and therefore persist across\ngateway restarts; however, some state information about the alert (such as: whether\nit is active or not and a historical record of when it was triggered in the past)\nwill be lost when the gateway is restarted, since it is stored in memory.\n\n\nAlerts and Topics\n\n\nAs described above the trigger for an alert is a JavaScript expression potentially\ninvolving a variety of metrics. When the expression evaluates to true and remains so\nfor a configured duration, the alert becomes active and email is sent to a configured\nlist of addresses. Likewise, when the condition turns false, the alert becomes inactive\nand another email about the state change is sent.\n\n\nHere is an example for simple JavaScript condition; we can make a REST call to create an\nalert named \nxyz\n which emails to \nsomeone@company.com\n when the number of running\napplications is greater than 5 for at least 60 seconds; the JSON object is the payload:\n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/systemAlerts/alerts/xyz\n\n\n{\n  \ncondition\n:\n_topic['cluster.metrics'].numAppsRunning \n 5\n,\n  \nemail\n:\nsomeone@company.com\n,\n  \ndescription\n: \nNo.of apps running is more than 5\n,\n  \ntimeThresholdMillis\n:\n60000\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the number of running applications is greater than 5 for more than 60 seconds, a simple\nemail will be sent to \nsomeone@company.com\n, stating that the alert is in effect, and when\nthe number of running applications drops below 6, another email will be sent, stating that\nthe alert is no longer in effect.\n\n\nThe condition is a simple JavaScript expression which the user can build\nfrom various system or application-specific values. These values are available as fields\nof JavaScript objects representing WebSocket topics obtained with expressions of the\nform \n_topic[\ntopic_name\n]\n.\nThe topic names can be looked up using the \nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/topicData\n REST API\ncall shown below (please note that alert names may contain special characters such as\nspaces, slashes and percents but they must be URL-encoded before making REST API calls\nsuch as \nGet\n, \nPut\n, and \nDelete\n):\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/systemAlerts/topicData\n\n\n{\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.logicalOperators\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.physicalOperators\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n.containers\n: {...},\n  \napplications.\napplicationId\n: {...}\n  \ncluster.metrics\n: {...},\n  \napplications\n: {...}\n}\n\n\n\n\nwhere \napplicationId\n refers to the application id of a running application\n(which typically has the form \napplication_1482319446115_4314\n). These topics\nexist for every running application. The alert condition can refer to multiple such topic values and\ncan be any valid JavaScript expressions that return a boolean. A comma separated list of\nemail addresses can be specified.\n\n\nConfiguring SMTP for Email\n\n\nSMTP needs to be configured for the gateway to be able to send alert emails via an \n\nSMTP server\n. Make\na note of the following steps before attempting to configure SMTP in the gateway.\n\n\n\n\nmake sure there is an SMTP server in the network the gateway will have access to. Note down the\nSMTP server's hostname and port number (please see the note below regarding encryption-type).\n\n\nif the SMTP server supports or requires \nTLS or SSL encryption\n,\ndetermine the encryption-type for the communication between the gateway and the SMTP server. The values for\nencryption-type are \"tls\", \"ssl\" or \"none\" (i.e. no encryption). In case \"tls\" or \"ssl\" is used,\nensure appropriate certificates are installed to establish \ntrust\n.\n\n\ndetermine the authentication-type for your SMTP server. The only supported values are \"password\" (i.e. authentication using\nusername and password) or \"none\" (i.e. no authentication).\n\n\nif you choose the \"password\" authentication-type, you will need the SMTP-username and SMTP-password to be used\nby the gateway to authenticate with the SMTP server.\n\n\ndetermine the \"fromAddr\" and the \"fromName\" for the emails sent by the gateway which the email recipient\nwill see as the sender of the emails. Note that for certain SMTP servers the \"fromAddr\" and the SMTP-username\nmay need to match or else the latter overrides the former.\n\n\ndetermine a \"test-address\" where you can receive emails to verify validity of the SMTP configuration.\n\n\nin case you choose the \"password\" authentication-type, you will need to set up an SSL keystore as described\n\nhere\n. The gateway uses the keystore to encrypt and\ndecrypt your SMTP-password.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the following APIs to set or retrieve the SMTP configuration. Note that the JSON sample following the\nPUT request is the payload of the request. \n\n\nPUT /ws/v2/config/smtp\n\n\n{\n\nhost\n: \nsmtp.gmail.com\n,\n\nport\n: \n587\n,\n\nfromAddr\n: \nno-reply@mydomain.com\n,\n\nfromName\n: \nDo Not Reply\n,\n\nencryptionType\n: \ntls\n,\n\nauthType\n: \npassword\n,\n\nusername\n: \nsmtp-user@mydomain.com\n,\n\npassword\n: \nsecret_password\n,\n\ntestAddr\n: \ntestuser@yourdomain.com\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nContents of the JSON Object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Key\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nthe SMTP hostname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport\n\n\nthe SMTP port on the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromAddr\n\n\nthe \"from-address\" described above i.e. the address from which the alert email is sent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromName\n\n\nthe \"from-name\" described above i.e. the user friendly string for the \"from-address\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencryptionType\n\n\nthe \"encryption-type\" value described above i.e. \"tls\", \"ssl\" or \"none\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthType\n\n\nthe \"authentication-type\" value described above i.e. \"password\" or \"none\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nthe \"SMTP-username\" value described above\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nthe \"SMTP-password\" value described above\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntestAddr\n\n\nthe \"test-address\" value described above. The gateway sends a test email to this address when you use this API to set the SMTP configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note about password: if you omit the \"password\" value in your JSON object in the API, the gateway will use the existing saved password\nso the client does not need to include the password in subsequent API calls. Note that the GET API (described below) never returns the\npassword of the SMTP configuration, hence the DataTorrent console is able to use this feature without either displaying or requiring the \nuser to re-enter the previous password. Note that the JSON sample following the GET request is the value returned from the GET request.\n\n\nGET /ws/v2/config/smtp\n\n\n{\n\nhost\n: \nsmtp.gmail.com\n,\n\nport\n: \n587\n,\n\nfromAddr\n: \nno-reply@mydomain.com\n,\n\nfromName\n: \nDo Not Reply\n,\n\nencryptionType\n: \ntls\n,\n\nauthType\n: \npassword\n,\n\nusername\n: \nsmtp-user@mydomain.com\n,\n\ntestAddr\n: \ntestuser@yourdomain.com\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe GET API returns the existing SMTP configuration in the gateway. As mentioned above, the SMTP-password\nvalue is never returned for security reasons.\n\n\nManaging and viewing alerts\n\n\nThe following operations are available in the Gateway REST API:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete an alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet alert history\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView content and status of alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView all the current data in the \n_topic\n array\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating an alert\n\n\nTo create an alert, the user needs to specify the alert name, condition,\nemail address and duration in milliseconds.

Note that for certain SMTP servers the \"fromAddr\" and the SMTP-username\nmay need to match or else the latter overrides the former.  determine a \"test-address\" where you can receive emails to verify validity of the SMTP configuration.  in case you choose the \"password\" authentication-type, you will need to set up an SSL keystore as described here . The gateway uses the keystore to encrypt and\ndecrypt your SMTP-password.   You can use the following APIs to set or retrieve the SMTP configuration.

Make sure\n    hadoop executable available in PATH variable\n\n\nJava 7 or 8 as supported by Hadoop distribution\n\n\nMinimum of 8G RAM available on the Hadoop cluster\n\n\nPermissions to create HDFS directory for DataTorrent user\n\n\nGoogle Chrome or Safari to access dtManage (DataTorrent UI\n    console)\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I start from after downloading DataTorrent RTS?\n\n\n\n\nAfter successful download of DataTorrent RTS, make sure all prerequisites are satisfied.\n\n\nYou will need to install DataTorrent RTS on Hadoop cluster using the downloaded installer. Refer to \ninstallation guide\n\n\nOnce installed, you will be prompted to proceed to dtManage, the DataTorrent management console, where you will be able to launch and manage applications.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the supported Hadoop distribution by DataTorrent RTS?\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS is a Hadoop 2.x native application and is fully\nintegrated with YARN and HDFS providing tight integration with any\nApache Hadoop 2.x based distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop Distribution\n\n\nSupported Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon EMR\n\n\nHadoop 2.4 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Hadoop\n\n\nHadoop 2.2 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudera\n\n\nCDH 5.0 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHortonworks\n\n\nHDP 2.0 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapR\n\n\n4.0 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nHDInsight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivotal\n\n\n2.1 and higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Datatorrent Sandbox?\n\n\nThe Sandbox provides a quick and simple way to experience DataTorrent RTS without setting up and managing a complete Hadoop cluster. The Sandbox contains pre-installed DataTorrent RTS Enterprise Edition along with all the Hadoop services required to launch and run the included demo applications.\n\n\nWhere do I get DataTorrent Sandbox download link?\n\n\nSandbox can be downloaded by visiting \ndatatorrent.com/download\n\n\nWhat are the system requirements for sandbox deployment?\n\n\nThe DataTorrent RTS Sandbox is a complete, stand-alone, instance of the\nEnterprise Edition as a single-node Hadoop cluster on your local\nmachine. Following are prerequisites for DataTorrent RTS:\n\n\n\n\nVirtualBox\n 4.3 or greater installed.\n\n\n6GB RAM or greater available for Sandbox VM.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the DataTorrent RTS package content details in sandbox?\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS + Apache Hadoop 2.2 (DataTorrent RTS 3.1 or earlier)\n\n\nLubuntu 14.04 LTS + Apache Hadoop 2.7 (DataTorrent RTS 3.2 or later)\n\n\nApache Apex, Apache Apex-Malhar\n\n\nDataTorrent Operator Library\n\n\nDataTorrent Enterprise Security\n\n\nDataTorrent dtManage\n\n\nDataTorrent dtAssemble\n\n\nDataTorrent dtDashboard\n\n\nDemo Applications\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the browser console on the sandbox say \nHDFS Not Ready\n ?\n\n\nThe HDFS services take a few minutes to start; the console needs all of\nthose services to be up and running and until that occurs, it displays this\nwarning. If the normal console does not appear after a few minutes, please run\nthe \njps\n command to see which services may \nnot\n be running, for example:\n\n\ndtadmin@dtbox:~/tmp$ jps\n1407 DTGateway\n4145 Jps\n2830 NodeManager\n3059 ResourceManager\n2650 NameNode\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that the \nDataNode\n is not running. In this case, stop all\nHDFS services (using, for example the script shown in the\n\nsandbox page\n. Then, remove everything\nunder these directories:\n\n\n/sfw/hadoop/shared/data/hdfs/datanode/current\n/sfw/hadoop/shared/data/hdfs/namenode/current\n\n\n\nNow reformat HDFS with \nhdfs namenode -format\n\nand finally, restart all HDFS services.\n\n\nIf all services are running and the normal console still does not appear,\nplease run following commands:\n\n\nhdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave\nhdfs fsck -delete\n\n\n\n\nIf HDFS detects that some files are corrupted (perhaps due to an earlier improper shutdown)\nit will not exit the initial safemode automatically;\nthe commands above exit safemode manually and delete corrupted files.\n\n\nHow do I get specific DT version ?\n\n\nYou can find archive list of various DataTorrent RTS versions at the bottom of each product download page.\n\n\nWhere can I request new / upgrade current license?\n\n\nPlease follow the instructions at \nLicense Upgrade\n\n\nWhere do I find product documentation?\n\n\nPlease refer to: \nDataTorrent Documentation\n\n\nWhere can I learn more about Apache Apex?\n\n\nYou can refer Apex page for more details: \nApache Apex\n\n\nDo you need help?\n\n\nYou can contact us at \nhttps://www.datatorrent.com/contact\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThere are multiple installations available e.g. Sandbox Edition, Community Edition, Enterprise Edition, dtIngest.

If using command line, use \ncurl\n instead of \nwget\n.\n\n\nWhy do I see the following permissions errors?\n\n\nDuring installation following error message will be seen on screen\n\n\n\n\nThese typically happen when specified directory does not exist, and the installation user does not have permissions to create it.  Following commands can be executed by user with sufficient privileges to resolve this issue:\n\n\n$ hadoop dfs -ls /user/\nUSER\n/datatorrent\n$ hadoop dfs -mkdir /user/\nUSER\n/datatorrent  \n$ hadoop dfs -chown \nUSER\n /user/\nUSER\n/datatorrent\n\n\n\nUpgrade\n\n\nLicense agent errors cause problems during upgrade from DataTorrent RTS 2.0 to 3.0.\n\n\nIf your applications are being launched continuously, or you are unable to launch apps due to licensing errors, try running complete uninstall and re-installation of DataTorrent RTS.  See \ninstallation guide\n for details.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nConfiguring Memory\n\n\nConfiguring Operator Memory:\n\n\nOperator memory for an operator can be configured in one of the following two ways:\n\n\n1 Using the same default values for all the operators: \n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPPLICATION_NAME\n.operator.*.attr.MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n2048\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nThis would set 2GB as size of all the operators in the given application.\n\n\n2 Setting specific value for a particular operator: Following example will set 8GB as the operator memory for operator \nOp\n.\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPPLICATION_NAME\n.operator.Op.attr.MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n8192\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of memory required by an operator should be based on maximum amount of data that operator will be storing in-memory for all the fields -- both transient and non-transient. Default value for this attribute is 1024 MB.\n\n\nConfiguring Buffer Server Memory:\n\n\nThere is a buffer server in each container hosting an operator with an output port connected to an input port outside the container. The buffer server memory of a container can be controlled by BUFFER_MEMORY_MB. This can be configured in one of the following ways:\n\n\n1 Using the same default values for all the output ports of all the operators\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPPLICATION_NAME\n.operator.*.port.*.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n128\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nThis sets 128Mb as buffer memory for all the output ports of all the operators.\n\n\n2 Setting specific value for a particular output port of particular operator: Following example sets 1GB as buffer memory for output port \np\n of an operator \nOp\n:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPPLICATION_NAME\n.operator.Op.port.p.attr.BUFFER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n1024\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nDefault value for this attribute is 512 MB\n\n\nCalculating Container memory:\n\n\nFollowing formula is used to calculate the container memory.\n\n\nContainer Memory = Sum of MEMORY_MB of All the operators in the container+ Sum of BUFFER_MEMORY_MB of all the output ports that have a sink in a different container.\n\n\n\nSometimes the memory allocated to the container is not same as calculated by the above formula, it is because actual container memory allocated by RM has to lie between\n\n\n[yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb, yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb]\n\n\n\nThese values can be found in yarn configuration\n\n\nConfiguring Application Master Memory:\n\n\nApplication Master memory can be configured using MASTER_MEMORY_MB attribute. Following example sets 4GB as the memory for Application Master:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPPLICATION_NAME\n.attr.MASTER_MEMORY_MB\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\n4096\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nDefault value for this attribute is 1024 MB. You may need to increase this value if you are running a big application that has large number of containers\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nHadoop dependencies conflicts\n\n\nYou have to make sure that the Hadoop jars are not bundled with the application package o/w they may conflict with the versions available in Hadoop classpath. Here are some of the ways to exclude Hadoop dependencies from the application package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your application is directly dependent on the Hadoop jars, make sure that the scope of the dependency is \nprovided\n. For eg if your application is dependent on hadoop-common, this is how you should add the dependency in pom.xml\n\n\ndependency\n\n  \ngroupId\norg.apache.hadoop\n/groupId\n\n  \nartifactId\nhadoop-common\n/artifactId\n\n  \nversion\n2.2.0\n/version\n\n  \nscope\nprovided\n/scope\n\n\n/dependency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your application has transitive dependency on Hadoop jars, make sure that Hadoop jars are excluded from the transitive dependency and added back as application dependency with provided scope as mentioned above. Exclusions in pom.xml can be set as follows\n\n\ndependency\n\n  \ngroupId\n/groupId\n\n  \nartifactId\n/artifactId\n\n  \nversion\n/version\n\n  \nexclusions\n\n    \nexclusion\n\n      \ngroupId\norg.apache.hadoop\n/groupId\n\n      \nartifactId\n*\n/artifactId\n\n    \n/exclusion\n\n  \n/exclusions\n\n\n/dependency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerialization considerations\n\n\nThe platform requires all operators and tuples in an Apex application to be serializable (and deserializable).\nAfter an application is launched, operators are serialized from the starting node and deserialized and \ninstantiated on various cluster nodes. Also checkpointing involves serializing and persisting an operator \nto a store and deserializing from the store in case of recovery. Tuples are serialized and deserialized \nwhen transmitted over a stream.\n\n\nProblems of lack of serializability (and deserializability) in the code can only be reliably uncovered at run-time.\nSo the recommended way to uncover these problems is to run the application in \n\nlocal mode\n before running on a cluster.\nUse the \nApexCLI\n to launch your application with the \n-local\n option\nto run it in local mode. When the platform runs into a situation where a field or object is not serializable or \ndeserializable, the application will fail at that point with a relevant exception logged on the console or the\nlog file as described in the \nKryo exception\n section. Check out \nthat section further for hints about troubleshooting serialization issues.\n\n\nTransient members\n\n\nCertain data members of an operator do not need to be serialized or deserialized during deployment or \ncheckpointing/recovery because they are \ntransient\n\nin nature and do not represent stateful data. Developers should judiciously use the \n\ntransient\n keyword for declaring\nsuch non-stateful members of operators (or members of objects which are indirectly members of operators) \nso that the platform skips serialization of such members and serialization/deserialization errors are \nminimized. Transient members are further described in the context of the operator life-cycle \n\nhere\n. Typical examples of\ntransient data members are database or network connection objects which need to be \ninitialized before they are used in a process, so there is no use of persisting them\nacross process invocations.\n\n\nGetting this message in STRAM logs. Is anything wrong in my code?\n\n\n2015-10-09 04:31:06,749 INFO com.datatorrent.stram.StreamingContainerManager: Heartbeat for unknown operator 3 (container container_1443694550865_0150_01_000007)\n\n\n\nComing soon.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nHow to remote debug gateway service?\n\n\nUpdate Hadoop OPTS variable by running,\n\n\nexport HADOOP_OPTS=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5432 $HADOOP_OPTS\"\n\n\n\nHow to setup DEBUG level while running an application?\n\n\nAdd the following property to your properties file:\n\n\nproperty\n\n  \nname\ndt.application.\nAPP-NAME\n.attr.DEBUG\n/name\n\n  \nvalue\ntrue\n/value\n\n\n/property\n\n\n\n\nMy gateway is throwing the following exception.\n\n\n  ERROR YARN Resource Manager has problem: java.net.ConnectException: Call From myexample.com/192.168.3.21 to 0.0.0.0:8032\u00a0failed on connection\n  exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more  details see:[http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused)\u00a0at\n  sun.reflect.GeneratedConstructorAccessor27.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n  at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\n  ...\n\n\n\nCheck if the host where gateway is running has yarn-site.xml file. You need to have all Hadoop configuration files accessible to dtGateway for it to run successfully.\n\n\nWhen Apex is running in secure mode, YARN logs get flooded with several thousand messages per second.\n\n\nPlease make sure that the kerberos principal user name has an account with the\nsame user id on the cluster nodes.\n\n\nApplication throwing following Kryo exception.\n\n\n  com.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: Class cannot be created (missing no-arg constructor):\n\n\n\nThis means that Kryo is not able to deserialize the object because the type is missing default constructor. There are couple of ways to address this exception\n\n\n\n\nAdd default constructor to the type in question.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \ncustom serializer\n for the type in question. Some existing alternative serializers can be found at \nhttps://github.com/magro/kryo-serializers\n. A custom serializer can be used as follows:\n\n\n2.1 Using Kryo's @FieldSerializer.Bind annotation for the field causing the exception. Here is how to bind custom serializer.\n\n\n@FieldSerializer.Bind(CustomSerializer.class)\nSomeType someType\n\n\n\nKryo will use this CustomSerializer to serialize and deserialize type SomeType. If\nSomeType is a Map or Collection, there are some special annotations @BindMap and\n@BindCollection; please see \nhere\n.\n\n\n2.2 Using the @DefaultSerializer annotation on the class, for example:\n\n\n@DefaultSerializer(JavaSerializer.class)\npublic class SomeClass ...\n\n\n\n2.3 Using custom serializer with stream codec. You need to define custom stream codec and attach this custome codec to the input port that is expecting the type in question. Following is an example of creating custom stream codec:\n\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.ObjectInputStream;\nimport java.util.UUID;\nimport com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo;\n\npublic class CustomSerializableStreamCodec\nT\n extends com.datatorrent.lib.codec.KryoSerializableStreamCodec\nT\n\n{\n    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException\n    {\n        in.defaultReadObject();\n        this.kryo = new Kryo();\n        this.kryo.setClassLoader(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());\n        this.kryo.register(SomeType.class, new CustomSerializer()); // Register the types along with custom serializers\n    }\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 201411031405L;\n}\n\n\n\nLet's say there is an Operator \nCustomOperator\n with an input port \ninput\n that expects type SomeType. Following is how to use above defined custom stream codec\n\n\nCustomOperator op = dag.addOperator(\"CustomOperator\", new CustomOperator());\nCustomSerializableStreamCodec\nSomeType\n codec = new CustomSerializableStreamCodec\nSomeType\n();\ndag.setInputPortAttribute(op.input, Context.PortContext.STREAM_CODEC, codec);\n\n\n\nThis works only when the type is passed between different operators. If the type is part of the operator state, please use one of the above two ways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog analysis\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to adjust logging levels.  For details see \nconfiguration guide\n.\n\n\nHow to check STRAM logs\n\n\nYou can get STRAM logs by retrieving YARN logs from command line, or by using dtManage web interface.  \n\n\nIn dtManage console, select first container from the Containers List in Physical application view.  The first container is numbered 000001. Then click the logs dropdown and select the log you want to look at.  \n\n\nAlternatively, the following command can retrieve all application logs, where the first container includes the STRAM log.\n\n\nyarn logs -applicationId \napplicationId\n\n\n\n\nHow to check application logs\n\n\nOn dt console, select a container from the Containers List widget\n(default location of this widget is in the \u201cphysical\u201d dashboard). Then\nclick the logs dropdown and select the log you want to look at.\n\n\n\n\nHow to check killed operator\u2019s state\n\n\nOn dt console, click on \u201cretrieve killed\u201d button of container List.\nContainers List widget\u2019s default location is on the \u201cphysical\u201d\ndashboard. Then select the appropriate container of killed operator and\ncheck the state.\n\n\n\n\nHow to search for particular any application or container?\n\n\nIn applications or containers table there is search text box. You can\ntype in application name or container number to locate particular\napplication or container.\n\n\nHow do I search within logs?\n\n\nOnce you navigate to the logs page,  \n\n\n\n\nDownload log file to search using your preferred editor  \n\n\nuse \u201cgrep\u201d option and provide the search range \u201cwithin specified range\u201d or \u201cover entire log\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLaunching Applications\n\n\nApplication goes from accepted state to Finished(FAILED) state\n\n\nCheck if your application name conflicts with any of the already running\napplications in your cluster. Apex does not allow two applications with\nthe same name to run simultaneously.\nYour STRAM logs will have following error:\n\n\u201cForced shutdown due to Application master failed due to application\n\\\nappId> with duplicate application name \\\nappName> by the same user\n\\\nuser name> is already started.\u201d  \n\n\nConstraintViolationException during application launch\n\n\nCheck if all @NotNull properties of application are set. Apex operator\nproperties are meant to configure parameter to operators. Some of the\nproperties are must have, marked as @NotNull, to use an operator. If you\ndon\u2019t set any of such @NotNull properties application launch will fail\nand stram will throw ConstraintViolationException. \u00a0  \n\n\nEvents\n\n\nHow to check container failures\n\n\nIn StramEvents list (default location of this widget is in the \u201clogical\u201d\ndashboard), look for event \u201cStopContainer\u201d. Click on \u201cdetails\u201d button in\nfront of event to get details of container failure.\n\n\nHow to search within events\n\n\nYou can search events in specified time range. Select \u201crange\u201d mode in\nStramEvents widget. Then select from and to timestamp and hit the search\nbutton.\n\n\ntail vs range mode\n\n\ntail mode allows you to see events as they come in while range mode\nallows you to search for events by time range.\n\n\nWhat is \u201cfollowing\u201d button in events pane\n\n\nWhen we enable \u201cfollowing\u201d button the stram events list will\nautomatically scroll to bottom when new events come in.\n\n\nHow do I get a heap dump when a container gets an OutOfMemoryError ?\n\n\nThe JVM has a special option for triggering a heap dump when an Out Of Memory error\noccurs, as well an associated option for specifying the name of the file to contain\nthe dump namely \n-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError\n and \n-XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp/op.heapdump\n.\nTo add them to a specific operator, use this stanza in your configuration file\nwith \nOPERATOR_NAME\n replaced by the actual name of an operator:\n\n\n    \nproperty\n\n      \nname\ndt.operator.\nOPERATOR_NAME\n.attr.JVM_OPTIONS\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\n-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp/op.heapdump\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n\n\n\nTo add them to all your containers, add this stanza to your configuration file:\n\n\n    \nproperty\n\n      \nname\ndt.attr.CONTAINER_JVM_OPTIONS\n/name\n\n      \nvalue\n-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp/op.heapdump\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n\n\n\nWith these options, when an \nOutOfMemoryError\n occurs, the JVM writes the heap dump to the\nfile \n/tmp/op.heapdump\n; you'll then need to retrieve the file from the node on which the\noperator was running.\n\n\nYou can use the tool \njmap\n (bundled with the JDK) to get a heap dump from a running\ncontainer. Depending on the environment, you might need to run it as root and/or use\nthe \n-F\n option; here is a sample invocation on the sandbox:\n\n\ndtadmin@dtbox:~$ sudo jmap -dump:format=b,file=dump.bin -F 15557\nAttaching to process ID 15557, please wait...\nDebugger attached successfully.\nServer compiler detected.\nJVM version is 24.79-b02\nDumping heap to dump.bin ...\nHeap dump file created\n\n\n\nThe heap dump shows the content of the entire heap in binary form and, as such, is\nnot human readable and needs special tools such as\n\njhat\n or\n\nMAT\n to analyze it.\n\n\nThe former (\njhat\n) is bundled as part of the JDK distribution, so it is very convenient\nto use. When run on a file containing a heap dump, it parses the file and makes the data\nviewable via a browser on port 7000 of the local host. Here is a typical run:\n\n\ntmp: jhat op.heapdump \nReading from op.heapdump...\nDump file created Fri Feb 26 14:06:48 PST 2016\nSnapshot read, resolving...\nResolving 70966 objects...\nChasing references, expect 14 dots..............\nEliminating duplicate references..............\nSnapshot resolved.\nStarted HTTP server on port 7000\nServer is ready.\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that a heap dump is different from a thread dump. The\nlatter shows the stack trace of every thread running in the container and is useful\nwhen threads are deadlocked.\nAdditional information on tools related to both types of dumps is available\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\nConnection Refused Exception\n\n\nClassNotFound Exception\n\n\nLaunching apa vs jar\n\n\nDAG validation failed\n\n\nMultiple gateways running simultaneously, app not launched.\n\n\nHDFS in safe mode\n\n\nApplication stays in accepted state\n\n\nSome containers do not get resources (specially in case of repartition)\n\n\nInsufficient memory set to operator causes operator kill continuously.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the number of events same/different at input and output port of each operator?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShutdown vs kill option\n\n\n\n\nWhy shutdown doesn\u2019t work? (if some containers are not running)\n\n\nCan I kill multiple applications at same time?\n\n\nKilling containers vs killing application\n\n\nSTRAM failures (during define partitions)\n\n\nThread local + partition parallel configuration\n\n\nWhat to do when downstream operators are slow than the input  operators.\n\n\nI am seeing high latency, what to do?\n\n\nappConf in ADT (inside apa file) vs conf option in Apex CLI\n\n\nApplication keeps restarting (has happened once due to license agent during upgrade)\n\n\nOperator getting killed after every 60 secs (Timeout issue)\n\n\nHow to change commit frequency\n\n\nDifference between exactly once, at least once and at most once\n\n\nThread local vs container local vs node local\n\n\nCluster nodes not able to access edge node where Gateway is running\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers not sure when to process incoming tuples in end window or when to do it in process function of operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow partitioning works\n\n\n\n\nHow the data is partitioned between different partitions.\n\n\nHow to use stream-codec\n\n\nData on which ports is partitioned? By default default partitioner partitions data on first port.\n\n\nHow to enable stream-codec on multiple ports. (Join operator?? where both input-ports needs to receive same set of keys).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npom dependency management, exclusions etc. eg: Malhar library and\n    contrib, Hive (includes Hadoop dependencies, we need to explicitly\n    exclude), Jersey(we work only with 1.9 version) etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll non-transient members of the operator object need to be\n    serializable. All members that are not serializable cannot be saved\n    during checkpoint and must be declared transient (e.g. connection\n    objects). This is such a common problem that we need to dedicate a\n    section to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExactly once processing mode. Commit operation is supposed to be\n    done at endWindow. This is only best-effort exactly once and not\n    100% guaranteed exactly once because operators may go down after\n    endWindow and before checkpointing finishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to check checkpoint size. (large checkpoint size cause instability in the DAG).\n\n\n\n\nHow to add custom metrics and metric aggregator.\n\n\nExample of how to implement dynamic partitioning.",

If\nSomeType is a Map or Collection, there are some special annotations @BindMap and\n@BindCollection; please see  here .  2.2 Using the @DefaultSerializer annotation on the class, for example:  @DefaultSerializer(JavaSerializer.class)\npublic class SomeClass ...  2.3 Using custom serializer with stream codec. You need to define custom stream codec and attach this custome codec to the input port that is expecting the type in question. Following is an example of creating custom stream codec:  import java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.ObjectInputStream;\nimport java.util.UUID;\nimport com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo;\n\npublic class CustomSerializableStreamCodec T  extends com.datatorrent.lib.codec.KryoSerializableStreamCodec T \n{\n    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException\n    {\n        in.defaultReadObject();\n        this.kryo = new Kryo();\n        this.kryo.setClassLoader(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());\n        this.kryo.register(SomeType.class, new CustomSerializer()); // Register the types along with custom serializers\n    }\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 201411031405L;\n}  Let's say there is an Operator  CustomOperator  with an input port  input  that expects type SomeType.

Now users are able to associate fields to the data being processed by a DAG in order to associate this pipeline with a set of fields. When the fields are changed, the whole pipeline is updated accordingly.\n\n\nLicensing\n\n\nEvery customer including eval and free edition users will need a new license file to use the RTS 3.9.0 product.\n\n\nIn 3.9, we have updated our software licensing mechanism. Customers, including those using our Free license, will be required to obtain a new software license file from DataTorrent in order to use or upgrade to version 3.9.  Existing customers can visit Upgrade License to obtain a new license when ready.\n\n\nCustomers who download our sandbox environment or request a free or evaluation license will automatically receive a 3.9-compatible license.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nSecurity hardening enhancements in 3.9.0 enable users to configure LDAP Security directly in the product. While available previously, the additional functionality in our User Interface now makes LDAP configuration even easier, saving customers time.\n\n\nCentralized Log Aggregation\n\n\nTroubleshooting just got easier with this feature that enables a centralized facility for log aggregation.\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS 3.9 Support for 3rd Party Log Aggregation makes it even easier for customers to troubleshoot while in production with indexing, search and correlation, and a centralized facility for log aggregation. You can now integrate Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) or Splunk with RTS out of the box.  \n\n\nAdditional Features of RTS 3.9.0\n\n\nApache Beam Support\n\n\nThis feature is focused on making data processing easier, faster and less costly.\nApache Beam Support, aka Google DataFlow is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows and also data ingestion and integration flows, supporting EIPs and DSLs. This dataflow pipeline simplifies the mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming processing.\n\n\nBasic Batch Processing Support\n\n\nThis feature enables data to be read and processed in batch mode.\nDataTorrent\u2019s Batch Processing Support allows customers to use their batch-oriented architectures in order to integrate with support for external scheduling (i.e. through cron, Oozie, etc.).\n\n\nDeprecated Features of RTS 3.9.0\n\n\nThis section lists features and capabilities that have been either removed or planned for removal in DataTorrent RTS.\n\n\n\n\nApplication Data Tracker (ADT):  This feature will no longer be supported after the RTS 3.9.0 release.   ADT is determined to be not sufficiently scalable and requires execution of a separate application that is not directly built into the RTS platform.  ADT is replaced with the new Application Metrics feature.  The new Application Metrics feature available in RTS 3.9.0 provides the required scalability, is easier for developers to use, and does not require execution of a separate application.  \n\n\n\n\nApex Features\n\n\n\n\n[APEXCORE-594] Plugin support in Apex\n\n\n[APEXCORE-579] Custom control tuple support\n\n\n[APEXCORE-563] Have a pointer to container log filename and offset in StrAM events that deliver a container or operator failure event.\n\n\n[APEXCORE-655] Support RELEASE as archetype version when creating a project\n\n\n[APEXCORE-662] Raise StramEvent for heartbeat miss\n\n\n\n\nApex Bugs\n\n\n\n\n[APEXCORE-674] DTConfiguration utility class ValueEntry access level was changed\n\n\n[APEXCORE-663] Application restart not working.\n\n\n[APEXCORE-648] Unnecessary byte array copy in DefaultStatefulStreamCodec.toDataStatePair()\n\n\n\n\nDataTorrent RTS Bug Fixes\n\n\nBugs\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-8784] -

As part of this release, DataTorrent is providing AWS - EMR deployment script option for each available application template. As a result, development is simplified, enabling developers to more quickly and easily unlock value for customers. DataTorrent is focused on the goals of reducing complexity and removing dependency on Hadoop deployment, and this release represents progress in that direction.   \n\n\nApplication Configurations\n\n\nSimplifying customized application launches\n\n\nUsers can start with a single Application Package and create multiple Application Configurations to launch and run the applications on different environments (for instance, in test and development).  And, efficiencies can be realized across business units: one Application Package could have multiple configurations for multiple internal units.  Each Application Configuration introduces a safety feature, which ensures that only one instance of Application Configuration can run at a time.  The status whether Application Configuration is running or not, and controls to launch and stop the application instance are provided in the Application Configuration view.  This set of features improves management, adds safety, and increases transparency when managing and launching applications.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nImproving log visualizations to speed up debugging\n\n\nStrAM Event Grouping\n\n\nThe StrAM Events widget helps from development and operations perspectives to visualize notable events from the application launch and throughout its ongoing run.  With this release, StrAM events widgets now offers better readability by organizing these events into related groups.  For example, when multiple downstream operators are re-deployed due to a container failure. All events triggered by the system to restore normal function will be grouped under a single root event which caused the restarts.  With this improved readability, the user can quickly identify failure causes and then drill down into the logs for each event.\n\n\nGarbage Collection Widgets\n\n\nWith this release, developers can more easily visualize garbage collection data trends\u2014as opposed to sifting through logs. Three widgets are available for GC visualizations:\n\n\n\n\nGarbage collection log chart by heap.  Visualizes when memory is allocated and deallocated \n\n\nGarbage collection log table.  List memory allocation and deallocation details\n\n\nGarbage collection log chart by duration.  Visualizes how long it takes to deallocate memory \n\n\n\n\nLog Tailing \n Search\n\n\nUsers can follow the logs as they are generated (tailing) with the RTS UI Console.  In this release, users can now also perform searches even when tailing to focus on specific events and exclude the noise.\n\n\nAlert Templates\n\n\nSimplifying and expanding alert functionality\n\n\nIn 3.7.0, RTS introduced monitoring with alerts that a DevOps engineer could set up based on specific conditions. The 3.8.0 release continues to simplify and expand this functionality by adding:\n\n\n\n\nNine predefined system alert templates, including cluster and application memory usage, application status, and active container count, killed container alerts, etc.\n\n\nOption to disable alerts without deleting them.\n\n\nThe ability to configure custom SMTP settings for sending alert emails, instead of relying on Gateway\u2019s local node sendmail facility.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nSecurity enhancement in 3.8.0 applies to RTS deployment on secure Hadoop with Kerberos enabled. User's own Kerberos credentials can now be used directly by RTS to launch applications.  It is better from a security perspective.\n\n\nThe previous model involved using a single system user with Kerberos credential (Hadoop impersonation)  to launch applications. That requires access to the system Kerberos credential in order to refresh tokens before they expire.  With user\u2019s own Kerberos credential, that is no longer the case. \n\n\nLicensing\n\n\nWith the release of 3.8.0, DataTorrent is updating and simplifying its licensing policy.  What has changed?  \n\n\nStarting with 3.8, the Community Edition is no longer available. We are replacing the Community Edition with Free Edition.  Community Edition limited the features available to you, such as security.   Now with Free Edition you have access to all the features and tools of RTS up to a 128GB processing limit.\n\n\nPlease refer to the DataTorrent website for additional details.\n\n\nLicensing FAQ\n\n\nI have a Community Edition license. Is that edition still available?\n\nStarting with 3.8, the Community Edition is no longer available.   You can continue to use the Community Edition with RTS version 3.7.\n\n\nHow is license memory consumption calculated?\n\nLicense memory consumption is the sum of all running applications as can be seen in Configuration - License Information and Monitor.\n\n\nWhat will happen when my memory consumption exceed my license limit?\n\nYou\u2019ll receive a warning, which is shown for 30 minutes before most RTS features will be disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. Should you need to upgrade, you can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.\n\n\nHow will I know when my license is going to expire and what happens if the license expires?\n\nWe provide warnings at 30 days and 7 days before expiration date.  When a license expires, most RTS features will be immediately disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. You can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.  \n\n\nWhat can I do once RTS is locked (either because my license memory has been exceeded or its expiration date has passed)?\n\nUsers can view running applications and enter new license details to unlock RTS. The following capabilities are still accessible:\n\n Configure - System Configuration is available except for App Data Tracker\n\n Configure - License Information is available\n\n Configure - Installation Wizard is available\n\n Monitor - Application kill, inspect and shutdown are available\n\n Monitor - Application Overview (shutdown and kill only) per application is available\n\n Monitor - Containers (kill only)\n\n AppHub (download only, no import)\n\n Learn\n\n\nCan I reduce the number of applications and return to compliance?\n\nYes, you can do so if you have exceeded your memory capacity, assuming that your license has not expired\n\n\nCan I reduce the memory usage of an application and bring it back to license compliance?\n\nYes, assuming that your license has not expired.  Please note that you will have to restart the application.\n\n\nI have an enterprise license for my production cluster. Can I use the Free Edition in a non- production cluster?\n\nYes. It\u2019s worth noting that only community support is available for the Free Edition. Please visit the DataTorrent User group for RTS-related questions: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/dt-users\n\n\nFor the Apache Apex mailing list and meetups information, please go to\nhttps://apex.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists\n\n\nCan I buy DataTorrent support for Free Edition?\n\nUnfortunately, no. DataTorrent support is sold as part of our Enterprise Edition. If you\u2019re seeking support, you may consider upgrading.\n\n\nIs Application Master Container memory consumption included in the calculation for processing capacity?\n\nYes. Application Master Container consumes 1 GB by default and every application has its own Application Master. If application is not running, it does not run as well. It grows based on customer application build. Memory requirements increases along with the size of logical and physical DAG. Partitioners of an operator run in AppMaster.\n\n\nAdditional Features of 3.8.0\n\n\nMultiple gateway support\n\n\nThis allows simultaneous multiple gateway operations and increase fault tolerance due to management console failure. \n\n\nWhen there are multiple gateways (usually for High Availability), different developers may access them at the same time, with different or same user accounts. These activities will often result in simultaneous modification of the same resource stored in HDFS, and invalidate cache entries on each client. For example: When developer A tries to save a configuration package and developer B has edited and saved the same package, developer A will get an error. Developer A would then have to manually merge the differences. This release introduces a new file-based locking mechanism with HTTP ETag header to handle that scenario.\nKnown limitation: Alerts and visualization works correctly with single gateway only.\n\n\nRetain metric selections when returning to Monitor - Physical/Logical view\n\n\nBetter user experience since RTS will keep what users have selected to view (e.g. metrics) as they go from one screen to another. \n\n\nDataTorrent Apex Core fork\n\n\nRTS 3.8.0 is bundled with Apache Apex Core 3.5.0 plus forty feature and fixes that will be part of Apache Apex Core 3.6.0. Apex Core commits from Apr 3, 2017 will be included in RTS 3.9.0\n\n\nNew Feature\n\n\n\n\n[APEXCORE-579]        Custom control tuple support\n\n\n[APEXCORE-563]        Have a pointer to container log

3.7.0. This release fixes the issue. \n\n\nOther issues that are also fixed:\n\n\n\n\nIn 3.6.0, users have the option to override certain properties from the config file. This ability was missing in 3.7.0.\n\n\nGateway fails to recognize AppDataTracker application and it continuously relaunched on a Kerberized cluster.\n\n\nOn a Kerberized cluster, when the configuration parameters are specified in the \ndt-site.xml\n file in the user's home directory, the installation wizard does not allow the user to continue with the installation.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-10698] - Allow Custom Properties with Config XML file while launching an application\n\n\n[SPOI-10737] - AppDataTracker application relaunches continuously and fails in a Kerberized cluster.\n\n\n[SPOI-10932] - Installation Wizard does not allow to complete gateway configuration\n\n\n[SPOI-10773] - Application fails to run in fully enabled Kerberized mode (APEXCORE-616 - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/APEXCORE-616)\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 3.7.0\n\n\nRelease date: Dec 30, 2016\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe new features on this release are functionalities that will ease debugging an application and administering application alerts in production. \n\n\nOperation related features for a Dev Ops role:  \n\n\n\n\nManage and see a history of previous alerts so that users can be aware of potential issues before they become critical. \n\n\nView operator ID(s) and name(s) in the dtManage-Physical-Container list table to quickly identify what operators are in each container. \n\n\nFilter matching tuple recordings by searching across tuple recording data.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging features: When trying to troubleshoot or debug a distributed system, these capabilities allow users to quickly identify problem areas and easily drill down into relevant details (i.e. logs). \n\n\n\n\nNotify users when log files have been removed\n\n\nNew Application Attempts section under Monitor. It is located along other views such as logical and physical\n\n\nNew Application Master logs in Application Overview section\n\n\nNew log button shortcut in Stram Events and Physical Operator section\n\n\nShow dead container logs in Running applications. That is to show history of physical operator containers and logs in the physical operator view. For each previous incarnation, there are start time, end time, link to corresponding logs, root cause with error code, and recovery window id.\n\n\nShow the same details for killed or finished application like running application view.\n\n\nShow container history as default in Physical Operator view\n\n\nNew historic count field in Physical Operator view\n\n\nGet thread dump from a container. It is useful to analyze issues such as \"stuck operator\", and obtain statistics from the running JVM. In production environments users often don't have direct access to the machines, thus making it available through the REST API will help. \n\n\nOption to auto tail container logs. When viewing a container log via the UI, there is an option to periodically poll for more data (i.e. \"tail -f\" effect).\n\n\n\n\ndtAssemble\n\n\n\n\nNew validate button so that user can validate DAG without having to save. \n\n\nRemove auto save function. Save will be initiated by user only.\n\n\nSupport custom JSON input for tuple schema creation. This is particularly useful when user needs to add a large number of fields. \n\n\n\n\ndtDashboard\n\n\n\n\nNew gauge widget\n\n\n\n\nAppHub\n\n\n\n\nContinued to refine application templates in AppHub (introduced in RTS 3.6.0).  \n\n\n\n\nRTS 3.7.0 is based on Apache Apex Core 3.5.0 (released Dec 19, 2016) and Apache Apex Malhar 3.6.0 (released Dec 8, 2016).\n\n\nApache Apex Core 3.5.0\n\n\nThis release upgrades the Apache Hadoop YARN dependency from 2.2 to 2.6. The community determined that current users run on versions equal or higher than 2.6 and Apex can now take advantage of more recent capabilities of YARN. The release contains a number of important bug fixes and operability improvements. \nChange log: https://github.com/apache/apex-core/blob/v3.5.0/CHANGELOG.md\n\n\nApache Apex Malhar 3.6.0\n\n\nThe release adds first iteration of SQL support via Apache Calcite. Features include SELECT, INSERT, INNER JOIN with non-empty equi join condition, WHERE clause, SCALAR functions that are implemented in Calcite, custom scalar functions. Endpoint can be file, Kafka or internal streaming port for both input and output. CSV format is implemented for both input and output. See examples for usage of the new API.\n\n\nThe windowed state management has been improved (WindowedOperator). There is now an option to use spillable data structures for the state storage. This enables the operator to store large states and perform efficient checkpointing.\n\n\nThere was also benchmarking on WindowedOperator with the spillable data structures. From the result, the community significantly improved how objects are serialized and reduced garbage collection considerably in the Managed State layer. Work is still in progress for purging state that is not needed any more and further improving the performance of Managed State that the spillable data structures depend on. More information about the windowing support can be found at http://apex.apache.org/docs/malhar/operators/windowedOperator/.\n\n\nThis release also adds a new, alternative Cassandra output operator (non-transactional, upsert based) and support for fixed length file format to the enrichment operator. \nChange log: https://github.com/apache/apex-malhar/blob/v3.6.0/CHANGELOG.md\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-9921]   Delete widgets on default pane of physical operators needs to have warm

This particular release brought new features such as\n\n\n\n\nAllowing users to analyze \"stuck operator\" by obtaining stats from the running JVM (i.e. GC stats and thread dump)\n\n\nAbility to show/hide critical path in both logical and physical DAG\n\n\n\n\nApache Apex Malhar\n\n\nThe other important part of going to production is a library of operators that is more than just functional. They need to be fault tolerant, partitionable, support idempotency, and dynamically scalable. The recent release of Apache Apex Malhar 3.5.0 provides new and updated operators and APIs to bring those enterprise features. \n\n\n\n\nWindowed Operator that supports the windowing semantics outlined by Apache Beam and Google Cloud DataFlow, including the concepts of event time windows, session windows, watermarks, allowed lateness, and triggering.\n\n\nHigh level Java stream API now uses the aforementioned Windowed Operator to support stateful transformation with Apache Beam style windowing semantics.\n\n\nIntroduction of Spillable Data Structures that make use of Managed State.\n\n\nDeduper Operator to process  whether a given record is a duplicate or not\n\n\nEnricher Operator to join a stream with a lookup source and operate on any POJO object\n\n\nHBase input operator. Improve HBasePOJOInputOperator with support for threaded read\n\n\nFile Record reader module. It is useful for reading from files \"line by line\" in parallel and emit each line as seperate * tuple.\n\n\nJDBC Poll Input Operator\n\n\n\n\nFor the full release note, please go to\nhttps://blogs.apache.org/apex/entry/apache_apex_malhar_3_5\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-9232] Dedup with manage state operator marking all impression as duplicate\n\n\n[SPOI-9203]   \"check for updates\" option says 'no updated versions' and then displays updated packages\n\n\n[SPOI-9183]   Nested operator properties should follow order specified in the ORB on dtAssemble UI\n\n\n[SPOI-8827]   \"Check for updates\" option keeps loading the page when no updates are available\n\n\n\n\nImprovement\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-7343] - Ability to obtain a thread dump from a container\n\n\n[SPOI-8191] - Operator properties should follow order specified in the ORB on dtAssemble UI\n\n\n[SPOI-8352] - Warning message while restarting app should be changed\n\n\n[SPOI-8450] - Dedup ports connected to console should not write to log\n\n\n[SPOI-8722] - Logical DAG, Physical DAG - change \"Show/Hide String Locality\", \"Show/Hide Critical Path\" to checkbox.\n\n\n\n\nStory\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-6794] - HBase Input Operator\n\n\n[SPOI-6795] - Creation of Concrete Cassandra Output\n\n\n[SPOI-6932] - Module to read from HDFS Input record by record and emit it downstream\n\n\n[SPOI-7948] - JDBC Input Operator\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-7836] - Trend widget fails after dashboard save/reload with PiDemo app\n\n\n[SPOI-7886] - Duplicate ports show up in the UI for POJO operators\n\n\n[SPOI-8222] - Operator/module names under Operator Library, dtAssemble canvas and right side panel should be same\n\n\n[SPOI-8552] - App Package cache throws uncaught exception when package is not found, resulting in http status 500\n\n\n[SPOI-8721] - Column labeled buffer service size is showing bytes per second\n\n\n[SPOI-9084] - Refresh tokens failing in some scenarios with a login failure message\n\n\n[SPOI-9130] - dtConsole shows no applications on monitor tab\n\n\n[SPOI-9131] - gateway REST and WebSocket APIs for cluster metrics fail to report stats\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-8411] - Deduper operator using Managed State\n\n\n[SPOI-9004] - Deduper Documentation\n\n\n\n\nSub-task\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-8389] - ORB defaults for FileSystem related operators\n\n\n[SPOI-8390] - Added operator default values in Application.json for user visibility\n\n\n[SPOI-8410] - Kafka Input Operator Unit test failed\n\n\n[SPOI-8461] - AbstractKafkaInputOperator problems\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.4.0\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAffinity rules provides a way to specify hints on how operators should be deployed in a Hadoop cluster. There are two types of rules: affinity and anti-affinity rules. Affinity rule indicates that the group of operators in the rule should be allocated together. Anti-affinity rule, the new feature in Apache Apex 3.4.0, indicates that the group of operators should be allocated separately.\n\n\nThis release also includes a lot of bug fixes.

With the introduction of dtHub, DataTorrent now host and maintain an application distributor. You can access it through dtManage and easily install or update application without having to upgrade the whole RTS platform. Prior to dtHub, RTS installer packaged both platform and applications. In 3.3, they are decoupled with significantly reduced installer size. You can independently choose when to upgrade the platform and when to install/upgrade applications.\n\n\ndtManage\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting is made easier now that user can view the containers where physical operators have lived\n\n\nRTS Community Edition user can now view container logs and set log levels via dtManage. API for runtime DAG and property change are also available\n\n\nRTS Enterprise Edition is changed from 30 days to 60 days\n\n\nWhen an application is killed, RTS will delete the app directory according to policy  in dt-site.xml\n\n\n\n\ndtDasbhoard\n\n\n\n\nNew widgets for the dashboard: Geo coordinates with circles, Geo regions with gradient fill and single Value \n\n\n\n\ndtAssemble (beta)\n\n\n\n\nTop level \u201cDevelop\u201d takes users directly to Application Page\n\n\nNavigation changes on how user get to Tuple Schema. User goes to It is now \"Edit Application\" then \"Tuple Schema\"\n\n\nDevelopment (breadcrumb link)\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\n\nFileSplitter: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/file_splitter/\n\n\nBlock Reader: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/block_reader/\n\n\n\n\nApache Apex 3.3\n\n\n\n\nSupport for iterative processing. It is a building block to support machine learning\n\n\nAbility to populate DAG at application launch time\n\n\nPre checkpoint operator callback so that it can execute a logic before the operator gets checkpointed (e.g. flush file to HDFS)\n\n\nProvide the option for operator to do checkpointing in a distribute in-memory store. It is faster than HDFS due to disk i/o latency\n\n\nAdd group ID information in an applicatin package.  It is visible for application grouping in dtHub.\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues in 3.3\n\n\n\n\n[SPOI-7696] - Community edition (which gets activated after expired license) does not have newly added community features\n\n\n[SPOI-7471] -

You can continue to use the Community Edition with RTS version 3.7.  How is license memory consumption calculated? \nLicense memory consumption is the sum of all running applications as can be seen in Configuration - License Information and Monitor.  What will happen when my memory consumption exceed my license limit? \nYou\u2019ll receive a warning, which is shown for 30 minutes before most RTS features will be disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. Should you need to upgrade, you can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.  How will I know when my license is going to expire and what happens if the license expires? \nWe provide warnings at 30 days and 7 days before expiration date.  When a license expires, most RTS features will be immediately disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. You can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.    What can I do once RTS is locked (either because my license memory has been exceeded or its expiration date has passed)? \nUsers can view running applications and enter new license details to unlock RTS. The following capabilities are still accessible:  Configure - System Configuration is available except for App Data Tracker  Configure - License Information is available  Configure - Installation Wizard is available  Monitor - Application kill, inspect and shutdown are available  Monitor - Application Overview (shutdown and kill only) per application is available  Monitor - Containers (kill only)  AppHub (download only, no import)  Learn  Can I reduce the number of applications and return to compliance? \nYes, you can do so if you have exceeded your memory capacity, assuming that your license has not expired  Can I reduce the memory usage of an application and bring it back to license compliance? \nYes, assuming that your license has not expired.  Please note that you will have to restart the application.  I have an enterprise license for my production cluster. Can I use the Free Edition in a non- production cluster? \nYes. It\u2019s worth noting that only community support is available for the Free Edition. Please visit the DataTorrent User group for RTS-related questions: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/dt-users  For the Apache Apex mailing list and meetups information, please go to\nhttps://apex.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists  Can I buy DataTorrent support for Free Edition? \nUnfortunately, no. DataTorrent support is sold as part of our Enterprise Edition. If you\u2019re seeking support, you may consider upgrading.  Is Application Master Container memory consumption included in the calculation for processing capacity? \nYes. Application Master Container consumes 1 GB by default and every application has its own Application Master. If application is not running, it does not run as well. It grows based on customer application build. Memory requirements increases along with the size of logical and physical DAG. Partitioners of an operator run in AppMaster.",

Endpoint can be file, Kafka or internal streaming port for both input and output. CSV format is implemented for both input and output. See examples for usage of the new API.  The windowed state management has been improved (WindowedOperator). There is now an option to use spillable data structures for the state storage. This enables the operator to store large states and perform efficient checkpointing.  There was also benchmarking on WindowedOperator with the spillable data structures. From the result, the community significantly improved how objects are serialized and reduced garbage collection considerably in the Managed State layer. Work is still in progress for purging state that is not needed any more and further improving the performance of Managed State that the spillable data structures depend on. More information about the windowing support can be found at http://apex.apache.org/docs/malhar/operators/windowedOperator/.  This release also adds a new, alternative Cassandra output operator (non-transactional, upsert based) and support for fixed length file format to the enrichment operator. \nChange log: https://github.com/apache/apex-malhar/blob/v3.6.0/CHANGELOG.md",

Windowed Operator that supports the windowing semantics outlined by Apache Beam and Google Cloud DataFlow, including the concepts of event time windows, session windows, watermarks, allowed lateness, and triggering.  High level Java stream API now uses the aforementioned Windowed Operator to support stateful transformation with Apache Beam style windowing semantics.  Introduction of Spillable Data Structures that make use of Managed State.  Deduper Operator to process  whether a given record is a duplicate or not  Enricher Operator to join a stream with a lookup source and operate on any POJO object  HBase input operator.
